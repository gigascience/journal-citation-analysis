Here we report the human gut microbial composition in a population sample of 123 non-obese and 169 obese Danish individuals. We find two groups of individuals that differ by the number of gut microbial genes and thus gut bacterial richness. They contain known and previously unknown bacterial species at different proportions; individuals with a low bacterial richness (23% of the population) are characterized by more marked overall adiposity, insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia and a more pronounced inflammatory phenotype when compared with high bacterial richness individuals. The obese individuals among the lower bacterial richness group also gain more weight over time. Only a few bacterial species are sufficient to distinguish between individuals with high and low bacterial richness, and even between lean and obese participants. Our classifications based on variation in the gut microbiome identify subsets of individuals in the general white adult population who may be at increased risk of progressing to adiposity-associated co-morbidities.

Draft genome sequence of chickpea (Cicer arietinum) provides a resource for trait improvement	NATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article							POPULATION-STRUCTURE; L. GENOME; ARABIDOPSIS; CHROMOSOMES; INTEGRATION; EVOLUTION; QUALITY; LEGUME	Chickpea (Cicer arietinum) is the second most widely grown legume crop after soybean, accounting for a substantial proportion of human dietary nitrogen intake and playing a crucial role in food security in developing countries. We report the similar to 738-Mb draft whole genome shotgun sequence of CDC Frontier, a kabuli chickpea variety, which contains an estimated 28,269 genes. Resequencing and analysis of 90 cultivated and wild genotypes from ten countries identifies targets of both breeding-associated genetic sweeps and breeding-associated balancing selection. Candidate genes for disease resistance and agronomic traits are highlighted, including traits that distinguish the two main market classes of cultivated chickpea-desi and kabuli. These data comprise a resource for chickpea improvement through molecular breeding and provide insights into both genome diversity and domestication.

Wheat has since become a primary staple crop worldwide as a result of its enhanced adaptability to a wide range of climates and improved grain quality for the production of baker's flour(2). Here we describe sequencing the Ae. tauschii genome and obtaining a roughly 90-fold depth of short reads from libraries with various insert sizes, to gain a better understanding of this genetically complex plant. The assembled scaffolds represented 83.4% of the genome, of which 65.9% comprised transposable elements. We generated comprehensive RNA-Seq data and used it to identify 43,150 protein-coding genes, of which 30,697 (71.1%) were uniquely anchored to chromosomes with an integrated high-density genetic map. Whole-genome analysis revealed gene family expansion in Ae. tauschii of agronomically relevant gene families that were associated with disease resistance, abiotic stress tolerance and grain quality. This draft genome sequence provides insight into the environmental adaptation of bread wheat and can aid in defining the large and complicated genomes of wheat species.

However, the complex polyploid nature of its genome makes genetic and functional analyses extremely challenging. The A genome, as a basic genome of bread wheat and other polyploid wheats, for example, T. turgidum (AABB), T. timopheevii (AAGG) and T. zhukovskyi (AAGGA(m)A(m)), is central to wheat evolution, domestication and genetic improvement(1). The progenitor species of the A genome is the diploid wild einkorn wheat T. urartu(2), which resembles cultivated wheat more extensively than do Aegilops speltoides (the ancestor of the B genome(3)) and Ae. tauschii (the donor of the D genome(4)), especially in the morphology and development of spike and seed. Here we present the generation, assembly and analysis of a whole-genome shotgun draft sequence of the T. urartu genome. We identified protein-coding gene models, performed genome structure analyses and assessed its utility for analysing agronomically important genes and for developing molecular markers. Our T. urartu genome assembly provides a diploid reference for analysis of polyploid wheat genomes and is a valuable resource for the genetic improvement of wheat.

Here we present a 1.12-times coverage draft genome from a horse bone recovered from permafrost dated to approximately 560-780 thousand years before present (kyr BP)(2,3). Our data represent the oldest full genome sequence determined so far by almost an order of magnitude. For comparison, we sequenced the genome of a Late Pleistocene horse (43 kyr BP), and modern genomes of five domestic horse breeds (Equus ferus caballus), a Przewalski's horse (E. f. prze-walskii) and a donkey (E. asinus). Our analyses suggest that the Equus lineage giving rise to all contemporary horses, zebras and donkeys originated 4.0-4.5 million years before present (Myr BP), twice the conventionally accepted time to the most recent common ancestor of the genus Equus(4,5). We also find that horse population size fluctuated multiple times over the past 2 Myr, particularly during periods of severe climatic changes. We estimate that the Przewalski's and domestic horse populations diverged 38-72 kyr BP, and find no evidence of recent admixture between the domestic horse breeds and the Przewalski's horse investigated. This supports the contention that Przewalski's horses represent the last surviving wild horse population(6). We find similar levels of genetic variation among Przewalski's and domestic populations, indicating that the former are genetically viable and worthy of conservation efforts. We also find evidence for continuous selection on the immune system and olfaction throughout horse evolution. Finally, we identify 29 genomic regions among horse breeds that deviate from neutrality and show low levels of genetic variation compared to the Przewalski's horse. Such regions could correspond to loci selected early during domestication.

GENOME RESEARCH			English	Article							F-BOX GENE; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; LTR RETROTRANSPOSONS; DE-NOVO; SEQUENCE; IDENTIFICATION; ALIGNMENT; PROGRAM; TOOL; INCOMPATIBILITY	The draft genome of the pear (Pyrus bretschneideri) using a combination of BAC-by-BAC and next-generation sequencing is reported. A 512.0-Mb sequence corresponding to 97.1% of the estimated genome size of this highly heterozygous species is assembled with 194x coverage. High-density genetic maps comprising 2005 SNP markers anchored 75.5% of the sequence to all 17 chromosomes. The pear genome encodes 42,812 protein-coding genes, and of these, similar to 28.5% encode multiple isoforms. Repetitive sequences of 271.9 Mb in length, accounting for 53.1% of the pear genome, are identified. Simulation of eudicots to the ancestor of Rosaceae has reconstructed nine ancestral chromosomes. Pear and apple diverged from each other similar to 5.4-21.5 million years ago, and a recent whole-genome duplication (WGD) event must have occurred 30-45 MYA prior to their divergence, but following divergence from strawberry. When compared with the apple genome sequence, size differences between the apple and pear genomes are confirmed mainly due to the presence of repetitive sequences predominantly contributed by transposable elements (TEs), while genic regions are similar in both species. Genes critical for self-incompatibility, lignified stone cells (a unique feature of pear fruit), sorbitol metabolism, and volatile compounds of fruit have also been identified. Multiple candidate SFB genes appear as tandem repeats in the S-locus region of pear; while lignin synthesis-related gene family expansion and highly expressed gene families of HCT, C3'H, and CCOMT contribute to high accumulation of both G-lignin and S-lignin. Moreover, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism is a key pathway for aroma in pear fruit.

Assemblathon 2: evaluating de novo methods of genome assembly in three vertebrate species	GIGASCIENCE			English	Article								Background: The process of generating raw genome sequence data continues to become cheaper, faster, and more accurate. However, assembly of such data into high-quality, finished genome sequences remains challenging. Many genome assembly tools are available, but they differ greatly in terms of their performance (speed, scalability, hardware requirements, acceptance of newer read technologies) and in their final output (composition of assembled sequence). More importantly, it remains largely unclear how to best assess the quality of assembled genome sequences. The Assemblathon competitions are intended to assess current state-of-the-art methods in genome assembly. Results: In Assemblathon 2, we provided a variety of sequence data to be assembled for three vertebrate species (a bird, a fish, and snake). This resulted in a total of 43 submitted assemblies from 21 participating teams. We evaluated these assemblies using a combination of optical map data, Fosmid sequences, and several statistical methods. From over 100 different metrics, we chose ten key measures by which to assess the overall quality of the assemblies. Conclusions: Many current genome assemblers produced useful assemblies, containing a significant representation of their genes and overall genome structure. However, the high degree of variability between the entries suggests that there is still much room for improvement in the field of genome assembly and that approaches which work well in assembling the genome of one species may not necessarily work well for another.

Low concordance of multiple variant-calling pipelines: practical implications for exome and genome sequencing	GENOME MEDICINE			English	Article							DE-NOVO MUTATIONS; SHORT READ ALIGNMENT; GENOTYPE IMPUTATION; GENETIC-VARIATION; SMALL INSERTIONS; ASSOCIATION; AUTISM; FRAMEWORK; DELETIONS; SPECTRUM	Background: To facilitate the clinical implementation of genomic medicine by next-generation sequencing, it will be critically important to obtain accurate and consistent variant calls on personal genomes. Multiple software tools for variant calling are available, but it is unclear how comparable these tools are or what their relative merits in real-world scenarios might be. Methods: We sequenced 15 exomes from four families using commercial kits (Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform and Agilent SureSelect version 2 capture kit), with approximately 120X mean coverage. We analyzed the raw data using near-default parameters with five different alignment and variant-calling pipelines (SOAP, BWA-GATK, BWA-SNVer, GNUMAP, and BWA-SAMtools). We additionally sequenced a single whole genome using the sequencing and analysis pipeline from Complete Genomics (CG), with 95% of the exome region being covered by 20 or more reads per base. Finally, we validated 919 single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) and 841 insertions and deletions (indels), including similar fractions of GATK-only, SOAP-only, and shared calls, on the MiSeq platform by amplicon sequencing with approximately 5000X mean coverage. Results: SNV concordance between five Illumina pipelines across all 15 exomes was 57.4%, while 0.5 to 5.1% of variants were called as unique to each pipeline. Indel concordance was only 26.8% between three indel-calling pipelines, even after left-normalizing and intervalizing genomic coordinates by 20 base pairs. There were 11% of CG variants falling within targeted regions in exome sequencing that were not called by any of the Illumina-based exome analysis pipelines. Based on targeted amplicon sequencing on the MiSeq platform, 97.1%, 60.2%, and 99.1% of the GATK-only, SOAP-only and shared SNVs could be validated, but only 54.0%, 44.6%, and 78.1% of the GATK-only, SOAP-only and shared indels could be validated. Additionally, our analysis of two families (one with four individuals and the other with seven), demonstrated additional accuracy gained in variant discovery by having access to genetic data from a multi-generational family. Conclusions: Our results suggest that more caution should be exercised in genomic medicine settings when analyzing individual genomes, including interpreting positive and negative findings with scrutiny, especially for indels. We advocate for renewed collection and sequencing of multi-generational families to increase the overall accuracy of whole genomes.

Herbivores are often adapted to feed on a specific group of evolutionarily and biochemically related host plants(1), but the genetic and molecular bases for adaptation to plant defense compounds remain poorly understood(2). We report the first whole-genome sequence of a basal lepidopteran species, Plutella xylostella, which contains 18,071 protein-coding and 1,412 unique genes with an expansion of gene families associated with perception and the detoxification of plant defense compounds. A recent expansion of retrotransposons near detoxification-related genes and a wider system used in the metabolism of plant defense compounds are shown to also be involved in the development of insecticide resistance. This work shows the genetic and molecular bases for the evolutionary success of this worldwide herbivore and offers wider insights into insect adaptation to plant feeding, as well as opening avenues for more sustainable pest management.

Here we report a genomic analysis of TCC by both whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing of 99 individuals with TCC. Beyond confirming recurrent mutations in genes previously identified as being mutated in TCC, we identified additional altered genes and pathways that were implicated in TCC. Notably, we discovered frequent alterations in STAG2 and ESPL1, two genes involved in the sister chromatid cohesion and segregation (SCCS) process. Furthermore, we also detected a recurrent fusion involving FGFR3 and TACC3, another component of SCCS, by transcriptome sequencing of 42 DNA-sequenced tumors. Overall, 32 of the 99 tumors (32%) harbored genetic alterations in the SCCS process. Our analysis provides evidence that genetic alterations affecting the SCCS process may be involved in bladder tumorigenesis and identifies a new therapeutic possibility for bladder cancer.

Here we report findings from a whole-genome sequencing (WGS) study of 88 matched HCC tumor/normal pairs, 81 of which are Hepatitis B virus (HBV) positive, seeking to identify genetically altered genes and pathways implicated in HBV-associated HCC. We find beta-catenin to be the most frequently mutated oncogene (15.9%) and TP53 the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor (35.2%). The Wnt/beta-catenin and JAK/STAT pathways, altered in 62.5% and 45.5% of cases, respectively, are likely to act as two major oncogenic drivers in HCC. This study also identifies several prevalent and potentially actionable mutations, including activating mutations of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), in 9.1% of patients and provides a path toward therapeutic intervention of the disease.

Detection of Clinically Relevant Genetic Variants in Autism Spectrum Disorder by Whole-Genome Sequencing	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article							DE-NOVO MUTATIONS; COPY NUMBER VARIATIONS; INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY; STRUCTURAL VARIATION; FUNCTIONAL IMPACT; KALLMANN-SYNDROME; CHARGE SYNDROME; LARGE-SCALE; EXOME; RISK	Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) demonstrates high heritability and familial clustering, yet the genetic causes remain only partially understood as a result of extensive clinical and genomic heterogeneity. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) shows promise as a tool for identifying ASD risk genes as well as unreported mutations in known loci, but an assessment of its full utility in an ASD group has not been performed. We used WGS to examine 32 families with ASD to detect de novo or rare inherited genetic variants predicted to be deleterious (loss-of-function and damaging missense mutations). Among ASD probands, we identified deleterious de novo mutations in six of 32 (19%) families and X-linked or autosomal inherited alterations in ten of 32 (31%) families (some had combinations of mutations). The proportion of families identified with such putative mutations was larger than has been previously reported; this yield was in part due to the comprehensive and uniform coverage afforded by WGS. Deleterious variants were found in four unrecognized, nine known, and eight candidate ASD risk genes. Examples include CAPRIN1 and AFF2 (both linked to FMR1, which is involved in fragile X syndrome), VIP (involved in social-cognitive deficits), and other genes such as SCN2A and KCNQ2 (linked to epilepsy), NRXN1, and CHD7, which causes ASD-associated CHARGE syndrome. Taken together, these results suggest that WGS and thorough bioinformatic analyses for de novo and rare inherited mutations will improve the detection of genetic variants likely to be associated with ASD or its accompanying clinical symptoms.

The sequence was obtained by combining short-read sequencing data and optical mapping data from a high-throughput whole-genome mapping instrument. The whole-genome mapping data facilitated the assembly of super-scaffolds >5x longer by the N50 metric than scaffolds augmented by fosmid end sequencing (scaffold N50 = 3.06 Mb, super-scaffold N50 = 16.3 Mb). Super-scaffolds are anchored on chromosomes based on conserved synteny with cattle, and the assembly is well supported by two radiation hybrid maps of chromosome 1. We annotate 22,175 protein-coding genes, most of which were recovered in the RNA-seq data of ten tissues. Comparative transcriptomic analysis of the primary and secondary follicles of a cashmere goat reveal 51 genes that are differentially expressed between the two types of hair follicles. This study, whose results will facilitate goat genomics, shows that whole-genome mapping technology can be used for the de novo assembly of large genomes.

To identify genetic changes associated with the development of bat-specific traits, we performed whole-genome sequencing and comparative analyses of two distantly related species, fruit bat Pteropus alecto and insectivorous bat Myotis davidii. We discovered an unexpected concentration of positively selected genes in the DNA damage checkpoint and nuclear factor kappa B pathways that may be related to the origin of flight, as well as expansion and contraction of important gene families. Comparison of bat genomes with other mammalian species has provided new insights into bat biology and evolution.

We generated and analyzed draft genomes of the soft-shell turtle (Pelodiscus sinensis) and the green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas); our results indicated the close relationship of the turtles to the bird-crocodilian lineage, from which they split similar to 267.9-248.3 million years ago (Upper Permian to Triassic). We also found extensive expansion of olfactory receptor genes in these turtles. Embryonic gene expression analysis identified an hourglass-like divergence of turtle and chicken embryogenesis, with maximal conservation around the vertebrate phylotypic period, rather than at later stages that show the amniote-common pattern. Wnt5a expression was found in the growth zone of the dorsal shell, supporting the possible co-option of limb-associated Wnt signaling in the acquisition of this turtle-specific novelty. Our results suggest that turtle evolution was accompanied by an unexpectedly conservative vertebrate phylotypic period, followed by turtle-specific repatterning of development to yield the novel structure of the shell.

We used exome sequencing on 67 T-ALLs to gain insight into the mutational spectrum in these leukemias. We detected protein-altering mutations in 508 genes, with an average of 8.2 mutations in pediatric and 21.0 mutations in adult T-ALL. Using stringent filtering, we predict seven new oncogenic driver genes in T-ALL. We identify CNOT3 as a tumor suppressor mutated in 7 of 89 (7.9%) adult T-ALLs, and its knockdown causes tumors in a sensitized Drosophila melanogaster model(3). In addition, we identify mutations affecting the ribosomal proteins RPL5 and RPL10 in 12 of 122 (9.8%) pediatric T-ALLs, with recurrent alterations of Arg98 in RPL10. Yeast and lymphoid cells expressing the RPL10 Arg98Ser mutant showed a ribosome biogenesis defect. Our data provide insights into the mutational landscape of pediatric versus adult T-ALL and identify the ribosome as a potential oncogenic factor.

Genomic landscapes of Chinese hamster ovary cell lines as revealed by the Cricetulus griseus draft genome	NATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article							IN-SITU HYBRIDIZATION; COPY-NUMBER; RNA-SEQ; CHROMOSOME REARRANGEMENT; DNA LIBRARIES; STEM-CELLS; CHO; CULTURE; APOPTOSIS; CANCER	Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, first isolated in 1957, are the preferred production host for many therapeutic proteins. Although genetic heterogeneity among CHO cell lines has been well documented, a systematic, nucleotide-resolution characterization of their genotypic differences has been stymied by the lack of a unifying genomic resource for CHO cells. Here we report a 2.4-Gb draft genome sequence of a female Chinese hamster, Cricetulus griseus, harboring 24,044 genes. We also resequenced and analyzed the genomes of six CHO cell lines from the CHO-K1, DG44 and CHO-S lineages. This analysis identified hamster genes missing in different CHO cell lines, and detected > 3.7 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 551,240 indels and 7,063 copy number variations. Many mutations are located in genes with functions relevant to bioprocessing, such as apoptosis. The details of this genetic diversity highlight the value of the hamster genome as the reference upon which CHO cells can be studied and engineered for protein production.

We present the duck genome sequence and perform deep transcriptome analyses to investigate immune-related genes. Our data indicate that the duck possesses a contractive immune gene repertoire, as in chicken and zebra finch, and this repertoire has been shaped through lineage-specific duplications. We identify genes that are responsive to influenza A viruses using the lung transcriptomes of control ducks and ones that were infected with either a highly pathogenic (A/duck/Hubei/49/05) or a weakly pathogenic (A/goose/Hubei/65/05) H5N1 virus. Further, we show how the duck's defense mechanisms against influenza infection have been optimized through the diversification of its beta-defensin and butyrophilin-like repertoires. These analyses, in combination with the genomic and transcriptomic data, provide a resource for characterizing the interaction between host and influenza viruses.

Here we analyse the antibiotic resistance genes of gut microbiota from 162 individuals. We identify a total of 1,093 antibiotic resistance genes and find that Chinese individuals harbour the highest number and abundance of antibiotic resistance genes, followed by Danish and Spanish individuals. Single-nucleotide polymorphism-based analysis indicates that antibiotic resistance genes from the two European populations are more closely related while the Chinese ones are clustered separately. We also confirm high abundance of tetracycline resistance genes with this large cohort study. Our study provides a broad view of antibiotic resistance genes in the human gut microbiota.

Genome-wide signatures of convergent evolution in echolocating mammals	NATURE			English	Article							MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; MOLECULAR EVOLUTION; PARALLEL EVOLUTION; BATS; GENES; SELECTION; DOLPHINS; HEARING	Evolution is typically thought to proceed through divergence of genes, proteins and ultimately phenotypes(1-3). However, similar traits might also evolve convergently in unrelated taxa owing to similar selection pressures(4,5). Adaptive phenotypic convergence is widespread in nature, and recent results from several genes have suggested that this phenomenon is powerful enough to also drive recurrent evolution at the sequence level(6-9). Where homoplasious substitutions do occur these have long been considered the result of neutral processes. However, recent studies have demonstrated that adaptive convergent sequence evolution can be detected in vertebrates using statistical methods that model parallel evolution(9,10), although the extent to which sequence convergence between genera occurs across genomes is unknown. Here we analyse genomic sequence data in mammals that have independently evolved echolocation and show that convergence is not a rare process restricted to several loci but is instead widespread, continuously distributed and commonly driven by natural selection acting on a small number of sites per locus. Systematic analyses of convergent sequence evolution in 805,053 amino acids within 2,326 orthologous coding gene sequences compared across 22 mammals (including four newly sequenced bat genomes) revealed signatures consistent with convergence in nearly 200 loci. Strong and significant support for convergence among bats and the bottlenose dolphin was seen in numerous genes linked to hearing or deafness, consistent with an involvement in echolocation. Unexpectedly, we also found convergence in many genes linked to vision: the convergent signal of many sensory genes was robustly correlated with the strength of natural selection. This first attempt to detect genome-wide convergent sequence evolution across divergent taxa reveals the phenomenon to be much more pervasive than previously recognized.

Drug resistance mechanisms are only partially understood(3-5), and whether the current understanding of the genetic basis of drug resistance in M. tuberculosis is sufficiently comprehensive remains unclear. Here we sequenced and analyzed 161 isolates with a range of drug resistance profiles, discovering 72 new genes, 28 intergenic regions (IGRs), 11 nonsynonymous SNPs and 10 IGR SNPs with strong, consistent associations with drug resistance. On the basis of our examination of the dN/dS ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous SNPs among the isolates(6-8), we suggest that the drug resistance-associated genes identified here likely contain essentially all the nonsynonymous SNPs that have arisen as a result of drug pressure in these isolates and should thus represent a near-complete set of drug resistance-associated genes for these isolates and antibiotics. Our work indicates that the genetic basis of drug resistance is more complex than previously anticipated and provides a strong foundation for elucidating unknown drug resistance mechanisms.

Gut microbiota characterizations were determined with 16S rDNA-based high-throughput sequencing. T2DM-related dysbiosis was observed, including the separation of microbial communities and a change of alpha diversity between the different glucose intolerance statuses. To assess the correlation between metabolic parameters and microbiota diversity, clinical characteristics were also measured and a significant association between metabolic parameters (FPG, CRP) and gut microbiota was found. In addition, a total of 28 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were found to be related to T2DM status by the Kruskal-Wallis H test, most of which were enriched in the T2DM group. Butyrate-producing bacteria (e. g. Akkermansia muciniphila ATCCBAA-835, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii L2-6) had a higher abundance in the NGT group than in the pre-DM group. At genus level, the abundance of Bacteroides in the T2DM group was only half that of the NGT and Pre-DM groups. Previously reported T2DM-related markers were also compared with the data in this study, and some inconsistencies were noted. We found that Verrucomicrobiae may be a potential marker of T2DM as it had a significantly lower abundance in both the pre-DM and T2DM groups. In conclusion, this research provides further evidence of the structural modulation of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of diabetes.

Here we report a map of genome variation for a major fruit that encompasses similar to 3.6 million variants, generated by deep resequencing of 115 cucumber lines sampled from 3,342 accessions worldwide. Comparative analysis suggests that fruit crops underwent narrower bottlenecks during domestication than grain crops. We identified 112 putative domestication sweeps; 1 of these regions contains a gene involved in the loss of bitterness in fruits, an essential domestication trait of cucumber. We also investigated the genomic basis of divergence among the cultivated populations and discovered a natural genetic variant in a beta-carotene hydroxylase gene that could be used to breed cucumbers with enhanced nutritional value. The genomic history of cucumber evolution uncovered here provides the basis for future genomics-enabled breeding.

MOENCH; LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; WIDE PATTERNS; MAIZE; DOMESTICATION; DIVERSITY; SELECTION; RICE	Sorghum is a food and feed cereal crop adapted to heat and drought and a staple for 500 million of the world's poorest people. Its small diploid genome and phenotypic diversity make it an ideal C-4 grass model as a complement to C-3 rice. Here we present high coverage (16-45 x) resequenced genomes of 44 sorghum lines representing the primary gene pool and spanning dimensions of geographic origin, end-use and taxonomic group. We also report the first resequenced genome of S. propinquum, identifying 8 M high-quality SNPs, 1.9 M indels and specific gene loss and gain events in S. bicolor. We observe strong racial structure and a complex domestication history involving at least two distinct domestication events. These assembled genomes enable the leveraging of existing cereal functional genomics data against the novel diversity available in sorghum, providing an unmatched resource for the genetic improvement of sorghum and other grass species.

To determine the "antibiotic resistance potential" for entire microbial communities, we employ metagenomic data and quantify the totality of known resistance genes in each community (its resistome) for 68 classes and subclasses of antibiotics. In 252 fecal metagenomes from three countries, we show that the most abundant resistance determinants are those for antibiotics also used in animals and for antibiotics that have been available longer. Resistance genes are also more abundant in samples from Spain, Italy, and France than from Denmark, the United States, or Japan. Where comparable country-level data on antibiotic use in both humans and animals are available, differences in these statistics match the observed resistance potential differences. The results are robust over time as the antibiotic resistance determinants of individuals persist in the human gut flora for at least a year.

Metagenomic sequencing of the human gut microbiome before and after bariatric surgery in obese patients with type 2 diabetes: correlation with inflammatory and metabolic parameters	PHARMACOGENOMICS JOURNAL			English	Article						bariatric surgery; diabetes mellitus; inflammation; metabolism; metagenome; Roux-en-Y gastric bypass	Y GASTRIC BYPASS; ENERGY-EXPENDITURE; MEDICAL THERAPY; WEIGHT-LOSS; ECOLOGY; DISEASE	Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) has become a prominent therapeutic option for long-term treatment of morbid obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Cross talk and pathogenetic consequences of RYGB-induced profound effects on metabolism and gut microbiome are poorly understood. The aim of the present study therefore was to characterize intra-individual changes of gut microbial composition before and 3 months after RYGB by metagenomic sequencing in morbidly obese patients (body mass index (BMI) > 40 kg m(-2)) with T2D. Subsequently, metagenomic data were correlated with clinical indices. Based on gene relative abundance profile, 1061 species, 729 genera, 44 phyla and 5127 KO (KEGG Orthology) were identified. Despite high diversity, bacteria could mostly be assigned to seven bacterial divisions. The overall metagenomic RYGB-induced shift was characterized by a reduction of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes and an increase of Proteobacteria. Twenty-two microbial species and 11 genera were significantly altered by RYGB. Using principal component analysis, highly correlated species were assembled into two common components. Component 1 consisted of species that were mainly associated with BMI and C-reactive protein. This component was characterized by increased numbers of Proteobacterium Enterobacter cancerogenus and decreased Firmicutes Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Coprococcus comes. Functional analysis of carbohydrate metabolism by KO revealed significant effects in 13 KOs assigned to phosphotransferase system. Spearmen's Rank correlation indicated an association of 10 species with plasma total-or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and 5 species with triglycerides. F. prausnitzii was directly correlated to fasting blood glucose. This is the first clinical demonstration of a profound and specific intra-individual modification of gut microbial composition by full metagenomic sequencing. A clear correlation exists of microbiome composition and gene function with an improvement in metabolic and inflammatory parameters. This will allow to develop new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies based on metagenomic sequencing of the human gut microbiome.	[Graessler, J.; Chavakis, T.; Bornstein, A.

However, the PCR amplification involved in nearly all existing NGS protocols inevitably introduces taxonomic biases. In the present study, we developed new Illumina pipelines without PCR amplifications to analyze terrestrial arthropod communities. Results: Mitochondrial enrichment directly followed by Illumina shotgun sequencing, at an ultra-high sequence volume, enabled the recovery of Cytochrome c Oxidase subunit 1 (COI) barcode sequences, which allowed for the estimation of species composition at high fidelity for a terrestrial insect community. With 15.5 Gbp Illumina data, approximately 97% and 92% were detected out of the 37 input Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), whether the reference barcode library was used or not, respectively, while only 1 novel OTU was found for the latter. Additionally, relatively strong correlation between the sequencing volume and the total biomass was observed for species from the bulk sample, suggesting a potential solution to reveal relative abundance. Conclusions: The ability of the new Illumina PCR-free pipeline for DNA metabarcoding to detect small arthropod specimens and its tendency to avoid most, if not all, false positives suggests its great potential in biodiversity-related surveillance, such as in biomonitoring programs. However, further improvement for mitochondrial enrichment is likely needed for the application of the new pipeline in analyzing arthropod communities at higher diversity.

Currently, there are numerous attempts to employ tree shrews as models for a variety of human disorders: depression, myopia, hepatitis B and C virus infections, and hepatocellular carcinoma, to name a few. Here we present a publicly available annotated genome sequence for the Chinese tree shrew. Phylogenomic analysis of the tree shrew and other mammalians highly support its close affinity to primates. By characterizing key factors and signalling pathways in nervous and immune systems, we demonstrate that tree shrews possess both shared common and unique features, and provide a genetic basis for the use of this animal as a potential model for biomedical research.

Pulling out the 1%: Whole-Genome Capture for the Targeted Enrichment of Ancient DNA Sequencing Libraries	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article							HUMAN MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; NEANDERTHAL GENOME; HUNTER-GATHERERS; HYBRID SELECTION; CAVE; DAMAGE	Most ancient specimens contain very low levels of endogenous DNA, precluding the shotgun sequencing of many interesting samples because of cost. Ancient DNA (aDNA) libraries often contain <1% endogenous DNA, with the majority of sequencing capacity taken up by environmental DNA. Here we present a capture-based method for enriching the endogenous component of aDNA sequencing libraries. By using biotinylated RNA baits transcribed from genomic DNA libraries, we are able to capture DNA fragments from across the human genome. We demonstrate this method on libraries created from four Iron Age and Bronze Age human teeth from Bulgaria, as well as bone samples from seven Peruvian mummies and a Bronze Age hair sample from Denmark. Prior to capture, shotgun sequencing of these libraries yielded an average of 1.2% of reads mapping to the human genome (including duplicates). After capture, this fraction increased substantially, with up to 59% of reads mapped to human and enrichment ranging from 6- to 159-fold. Furthermore, we maintained coverage of the majority of regions sequenced in the precapture library. Intersection with the 1000 Genomes Project reference panel yielded an average of 50,723 SNPs (range 3,062-147,243) for the postcapture libraries sequenced with 1 million reads, compared with 13,280 SNPs (range 217-73,266) for the precapture libraries, increasing resolution in population genetic analyses. Our whole-genome capture approach makes it less costly to sequence aDNA from specimens containing very low levels of endogenous DNA, enabling the analysis of larger numbers of samples.

We generated a rock pigeon reference genome and additional genome sequences representing domestic and feral populations. We found evidence for the origins of major breed groups in the Middle East and contributions from a racing breed to North American feral populations. We identified the gene EphB2 as a strong candidate for the derived head crest phenotype shared by numerous breeds, an important trait in mate selection in many avian species. We also found evidence that this trait evolved just once and spread throughout the species, and that the crest originates early in development by the localized molecular reversal of feather bud polarity.

Here, we report the identification, by homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing, of a SYNJ1 homozygous mutation (p.Arg258Gln) segregating with disease in an Italian consanguineous family with Parkinsonism, dystonia, and cognitive deterioration. Response to levodopa was poor, and limited by side effects. Neuroimaging revealed brain atrophy, nigrostriatal dopaminergic defects, and cerebral hypometabolism. SYNJ1 encodes synaptojanin 1, a phosphoinositide phosphatase protein with essential roles in the postendocytic recycling of synaptic vesicles. The mutation is absent in variation databases and in ethnically matched controls, is damaging according to all prediction programs, and replaces an amino acid that is extremely conserved in the synaptojanin 1 homologues and in SAC1-like domains of other proteins. Sequencing the SYNJ1ORF in unrelated patients revealed another heterozygous mutation (p.Ser1422Arg), predicted as damaging, in a patient who also carries a heterozygous PINK1 truncating mutation. The SYNJ1 gene is a compelling candidate for Parkinsonism; mutations in the functionally linked protein auxilin cause a similar early-onset phenotype, and other findings implicate endosomal dysfunctions in the pathogenesis. Our data delineate a novel form of human Mendelian Parkinsonism, and provide further evidence for abnormal synaptic vesicle recycling as a central theme in the pathogenesis.

Arthropods compete with humans for food and transmit devastating diseases. They also comprise the most diverse and successful branch of metazoan evolution, with millions of extant species. Here, we describe an international effort to guide arthropod genomic efforts, from species prioritization to methodology and informatics. The 5000 arthropod genomes initiative (i5K) community met formally in 2012 to discuss a roadmap for sequencing and analyzing 5000 high-priority arthropods and is continuing this effort via pilot projects, the development of standard operating procedures, and training of students and career scientists, With university, governmental, and industry support, the i5K Consortium aspires to deliver sequences and analytical tools for each of the arthropod branches and each of the species having beneficial and negative effects on humankind.

Although global climate change and anthropogenic disturbances are recognized to shape animal population demography(2,3) their contribution to panda population dynamics remains largely unknown. We sequenced the whole genomes of 34 pandas at an average 4.7-fold coverage and used this data set together with the previously deep-sequenced panda genome(4) to reconstruct a continuous demographic history of pandas from their origin to the present. We identify two population expansions, two bottlenecks and two divergences. Evidence indicated that, whereas global changes in climate were the primary drivers of population fluctuation for millions of years, human activities likely underlie recent population divergence and serious decline. We identified three distinct panda populations that show genetic adaptation to their environments. However, in all three populations, anthropogenic activities have negatively affected pandas for 3,000 years.

Complementing the silkworm genome sequence, here we describe the genome of a mulberry species Morus notabilis. In the 330-Mb genome assembly, we identify 128Mb of repetitive sequences and 29,338 genes, 60.8% of which are supported by transcriptome sequencing. Mulberry gene sequences appear to evolve similar to 3 times faster than other Rosales, perhaps facilitating the species' spread worldwide. The mulberry tree is among a few eudicots but several Rosales that have not preserved genome duplications in more than 100 million years; however, a neopolyploid series found in the mulberry tree and several others suggest that new duplications may confer benefits. Five predicted mulberry miRNAs are found in the haemolymph and silk glands of the silkworm, suggesting interactions at molecular levels in the plant-herbivore relationship. The identification and analyses of mulberry genes involved in diversifying selection, resistance and protease inhibitor expressed in the laticifers will accelerate the improvement of mulberry plants.

Methods Five cases with secondary findings were reviewed. Results In Case 1, NIPT revealed a large duplication in chromosome 18p, which was supported by arrayCGH of amniocyte DNA, with final karyotype showing mosaic tetrasomy 18p. In Case 2, a deletion in the proximal long arm of chromosome 18 of maternal origin was suspected and confirmed by arrayCGH of maternal white cell DNA. In Case 3, NIPT was negative for trisomies 21 and 18. In-depth analysis for deletions/duplications was requested when fetal structural anomalies were detected at routine scan. A deletion in the proximal long arm of chromosome 3 was found and confirmed by karyotyping. In Case 4, NIPT correctly predicted confined placental mosaicism with triple trisomy involving chromosomes X, 7 and 21. In Case 5, NIPT correctly detected a previously unknown maternal mosaicism for 45X. Conclusion Non-invasive prenatal testing is able to detect a wide range of fetal, placental and maternal chromosomal abnormalities. This has important implications on patient counseling when an abnormality is detected by NIPT. (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

These insights have been obtained, in part, through the work of large-scale, consortium-driven metagenomic projects. Here, five experts in the field of microbiome research discuss the most surprising and exciting new findings, and outline the future steps that will be necessary to elucidate the numerous roles of the microbiota in human health and disease and to develop viable therapeutic strategies.

To elucidate the consequences of artificial selection accompanying the domestication and modern improvement of soybean, 25 new and 30 published whole-genome re-sequencing accessions, which represent wild, domesticated landrace, and Chinese elite soybean populations were analyzed. Results: A total of 5,102,244 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 707,969 insertion/deletions were identified. Among the SNPs detected, 25.5% were not described previously. We found that artificial selection during domestication led to more pronounced reduction in the genetic diversity of soybean than the switch from landraces to elite cultivars. Only a small proportion (2.99%) of the whole genomic regions appear to be affected by artificial selection for preferred agricultural traits. The selection regions were not distributed randomly or uniformly throughout the genome. Instead, clusters of selection hotspots in certain genomic regions were observed. Moreover, a set of candidate genes (4.38% of the total annotated genes) significantly affected by selection underlying soybean domestication and genetic improvement were identified. Conclusions: Given the uniqueness of the soybean germplasm sequenced, this study drew a clear picture of human-mediated evolution of the soybean genomes. The genomic resources and information provided by this study would also facilitate the discovery of genes/loci underlying agronomically important traits.

We sequenced the exomes of 1,000 Danish cases with common forms of type 2 diabetes (including body mass index > 27.5 kg/m(2) and hypertension) and 1,000 healthy controls to an average depth of 56x. Our simulations suggest that our study had the statistical power to detect at least one causal gene (a gene containing causal mutations) if the heritability of these common diseases was explained by rare variants in the coding regions of a limited number of genes. We applied a series of gene-based tests to detect such susceptibility genes. However, no gene showed a significant association with disease risk after we corrected for the number of genes analyzed. Thus, we could reject a model for the genetic architecture of type 2 diabetes where rare nonsynonymous variants clustered in a modest number of genes (fewer than 20) are responsible for the majority of disease risk.

Peregrine and saker falcon genome sequences provide insights into evolution of a predatory lifestyle	NATURE GENETICS			English	Article							RECEPTOR GENE REPERTOIRES; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; DARWINS FINCHES; PHYLOGENETIC TREES; COPY NUMBER; BIRDS; REVEALS; SECRETION; ALIGNMENT; HISTORY	As top predators, falcons possess unique morphological, physiological and behavioral adaptations that allow them to be successful hunters: for example, the peregrine is renowned as the world's fastest animal. To examine the evolutionary basis of predatory adaptations, we sequenced the genomes of both the peregrine (Falco peregrinus) and saker falcon (Falco cherrug), and we present parallel, genome-wide evidence for evolutionary innovation and selection for a predatory lifestyle. The genomes, assembled using Illumina deep sequencing with greater than 100-fold coverage, are both approximately 1.2 Gb in length, with transcriptome-assisted prediction of approximately 16,200 genes for both species. Analysis of 8,424 orthologs in both falcons, chicken, zebra finch and turkey identified consistent evidence for genome-wide rapid evolution in these raptors. SNP-based inference showed contrasting recent demographic trajectories for the two falcons, and gene-based analysis highlighted falcon-specific evolutionary novelties for beak development and olfaction and specifically for homeostasis-related genes in the arid environment-adapted saker.

For most loci, the variants that cause disease are not known and the genes affected by these variants have not been identified. We aimed to identify variants that cause CD through detailed sequencing, genetic association, expression, and functional studies. METHODS: We sequenced whole exomes of 42 unrelated subjects with CD and 5 healthy subjects (controls) and then filtered single nucleotide variants by incorporating association results from meta-analyses of CD GWAS and in silico mutation effect prediction algorithms. We then genotyped 9348 subjects with CD, 2868 subjects with ulcerative colitis, and 14,567 control subjects and associated variants analyzed in functional studies using materials from subjects and controls and in vitro model systems. RESULTS: We identified rare missense mutations in PR domain-containing 1 (PRDM1) and associated these with CD. These mutations increased proliferation of T cells and secretion of cytokines on activation and increased expression of the adhesion molecule L-selectin. A common CD risk allele, identified in GWAS, correlated with reduced expression of PRDM1 in ileal biopsy specimens and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (combined P = 1.6 x 10(-8)). We identified an association between CD and a common missense variant, Val248Ala, in nuclear domain 10 protein 52 (NDP52) (P = 4.83 x 10(-9)). We found that this variant impairs the regulatory functions of NDP52 to inhibit nuclear factor kappa B activation of genes that regulate inflammation and affect the stability of proteins in Toll-like receptor pathways. CONCLUSIONS: We have extended the results of GWAS and provide evidence that variants in PRDM1 and NDP52 determine susceptibility to CD. PRDM1 maps adjacent to a CD interval identified in GWAS and encodes a transcription factor expressed by T and B cells. NDP52 is an adaptor protein that functions in selective autophagy of intracellular bacteria and signaling molecules, supporting the role of autophagy in the pathogenesis of CD.

Its genome is very similar and collinear to that of the closely related mesophytic congener, P. trichocarpa. However, we find that several gene families likely to be involved in tolerance to salt stress contain significantly more gene copies within the P. euphratica lineage. Furthermore, genes showing evidence of positive selection are significantly enriched in functional categories related to salt stress. Some of these genes, and others within the same categories, are significantly upregulated under salt stress relative to their expression in another salt-sensitive poplar. Our results provide an important background for understanding tree adaptation to salt stress and facilitating the genetic improvement of cultivated poplars for saline soils.

Genetic Recombination Is Targeted towards Gene Promoter Regions in Dogs	PLOS GENETICS			English	Article							HISTONE H3 METHYLTRANSFERASE; MEIOTIC RECOMBINATION; HUMAN GENOME; HOT-SPOTS; PRDM9; HOTSPOTS; MOUSE; MAP; FEATURES; HUMANS	The identification of the H3K4 trimethylase, PRDM9, as the gene responsible for recombination hotspot localization has provided considerable insight into the mechanisms by which recombination is initiated in mammals. However, uniquely amongst mammals, canids appear to lack a functional version of PRDM9 and may therefore provide a model for understanding recombination that occurs in the absence of PRDM9, and thus how PRDM9 functions to shape the recombination landscape. We have constructed a fine-scale genetic map from patterns of linkage disequilibrium assessed using high-throughput sequence data from 51 free-ranging dogs, Canis lupus familiaris. While broad-scale properties of recombination appear similar to other mammalian species, our fine-scale estimates indicate that canine highly elevated recombination rates are observed in the vicinity of CpG rich regions including gene promoter regions, but show little association with H3K4 trimethylation marks identified in spermatocytes. By comparison to genomic data from the Andean fox, Lycalopex culpaeus, we show that biased gene conversion is a plausible mechanism by which the high CpG content of the dog genome could have occurred.

Here we report the de novo assembly of an Amur tiger whole-genome sequence as well as the genomic sequences of a white Bengal tiger, African lion, white African lion and snow leopard. Through comparative genetic analyses of these genomes, we find genetic signatures that may reflect molecular adaptations consistent with the big cats' hypercarnivorous diet and muscle strength. We report a snow leopard-specific genetic determinant in EGLN1 (Met39 > Lys39), which is likely to be associated with adaptation to high altitude. We also detect a TYR260G > A mutation likely responsible for the white lion coat colour. Tiger and cat genomes show similar repeat composition and an appreciably conserved synteny. Genomic data from the five big cats provide an invaluable resource for resolving easily identifiable phenotypes evident in very close, but distinct, species.

Genome analysis reveals insights into physiology and longevity of the Brandt's bat Myotis brandtii	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							GROWTH-FACTOR-I; SEQUENCE EVOLUTION; ECHOLOCATING BATS; BROWN BAT; LIFE-SPAN; RNA-SEQ; RECEPTOR; HORMONE; MICE; SIZE	Bats account for one-fifth of mammalian species, are the only mammals with powered flight, and are among the few animals that echolocate. The insect-eating Brandt's bat (Myotis brandtii) is the longest-lived bat species known to date (lifespan exceeds 40 years) and, at 4-8 g adult body weight, is the most extreme mammal with regard to disparity between body mass and longevity. Here we report sequencing and analysis of the Brandt's bat genome and transcriptome, which suggest adaptations consistent with echolocation and hibernation, as well as altered metabolism, reproduction and visual function. Unique sequence changes in growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptors are also observed. The data suggest that an altered growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor 1 axis, which may be common to other long-lived bat species, together with adaptations such as hibernation and low reproductive rate, contribute to the exceptional lifespan of the Brandt's bat.

Here we generate a draft genome of this artiodactyl and use it to detect the potential genetic bases of highland adaptation. Compared with other plain-dwelling mammals, the genome of the Tibetan antelope shows signals of adaptive evolution and gene-family expansion in genes associated with energy metabolism and oxygen transmission. Both the highland American pika, and the Tibetan antelope have signals of positive selection for genes involved in DNA repair and the production of ATPase. Genes associated with hypoxia seem to have experienced convergent evolution. Thus, our study suggests that common genetic mechanisms might have been utilized to enable high-altitude adaptation.

DESIR Study Grp; DIAGRAM Consortium	Exome sequencing-driven discovery of coding polymorphisms associated with common metabolic phenotypes	DIABETOLOGIA			English	Article						Exome sequencing; Genetic epidemiology; Genetics; Lipids; Next-generation sequencing; Obesity; Type 2 diabetes	GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; DIABETES SUSCEPTIBILITY LOCI; DE-NOVO MUTATIONS; GLUCOSE-HOMEOSTASIS; IDENTIFIES 6; VARIANTS; RISK; METAANALYSIS; INDIVIDUALS; EFFICIENT	Human complex metabolic traits are in part regulated by genetic determinants. Here we applied exome sequencing to identify novel associations of coding polymorphisms at minor allele frequencies (MAFs) > 1% with common metabolic phenotypes. The study comprised three stages. We performed medium-depth (8x) whole exome sequencing in 1,000 cases with type 2 diabetes, BMI > 27.5 kg/m(2) and hypertension and in 1,000 controls (stage 1). We selected 16,192 polymorphisms nominally associated (p < 0.05) with case-control status, from four selected annotation categories or from loci reported to associate with metabolic traits. These variants were genotyped in 15,989 Danes to search for association with 12 metabolic phenotypes (stage 2). In stage 3, polymorphisms showing potential associations were genotyped in a further 63,896 Europeans. Exome sequencing identified 70,182 polymorphisms with MAF > 1%. In stage 2 we identified 51 potential associations with one or more of eight metabolic phenotypes covered by 45 unique polymorphisms. In meta-analyses of stage 2 and stage 3 results, we demonstrated robust associations for coding polymorphisms in CD300LG (fasting HDL-cholesterol: MAF 3.5%, p = 8.5 x 10(-14)), COBLL1 (type 2 diabetes: MAF 12.5%, OR 0.88, p = 1.2 x 10(-11)) and MACF1 (type 2 diabetes: MAF 23.4%, OR 1.10, p = 8.2 x 10(-10)). We applied exome sequencing as a basis for finding genetic determinants of metabolic traits and show the existence of low-frequency and common coding polymorphisms with impact on common metabolic traits. Based on our study, coding polymorphisms with MAF above 1% do not seem to have particularly high effect sizes on the measured metabolic traits.

Here we report a 110-Mb draft sequence of Pst isolate CY32, obtained using a 'fosmid-to-fosmid' strategy, to better understand its race evolution and pathogenesis. The Pst genome is highly heterozygous and contains 25,288 protein-coding genes. Compared with non-obligate fungal pathogens, Pst has a more diverse gene composition and more genes encoding secreted proteins. Re-sequencing analysis indicates significant genetic variation among six isolates collected from different continents. Approximately 35% of SNPs are in the coding sequence regions, and half of them are non-synonymous. High genetic diversity in Pst suggests that sexual reproduction has an important role in the origin of different regional races. Our results show the effectiveness of the 'fosmid-to-fosmid' strategy for sequencing dikaryotic genomes and the feasibility of genome analysis to understand race evolution in Pst and other obligate pathogens.

In this study, we addressed this issue by targeted next-generation sequencing of a large cohort of non-syndromic deaf probands. Methods: Probands with mutations in commonly screened deafness genes GJB2, SLC26A4 and MT-RNR1 were pre-excluded by Sanger sequencing. The remaining 125 deaf probands proceeded through targeted exon capturing of 79 known deafness genes and Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencing. Results: Bi-allelic mutations in 15 less commonly screened deafness genes were identified in 28 deaf probands, with mutations in MYO15A, GPR98, TMC1, USH2A and PCDH15 being relatively more frequent (>= 3 probands each). Dominant mutations in MYO6, TECTA, POU4F3 and COCH were identified in 4 deaf families. A mitochondrial MTTS1 mutation was identified in one maternally inherited deaf family. No pathogenic mutations were identified in three dominant deaf families and two consanguineous families. Conclusions: Mutations in the less commonly screened deafness genes were heterogeneous and contributed to a significant percentage (17.4%) of causes for non-syndromic deafness. Targeted next-generation sequencing provided a comprehensive and efficient diagnosis for known deafness genes. Complementary to linkage analysis or whole-exome sequencing of deaf families, pre-exclusion of known deafness genes by this strategy may facilitate the discovery of novel deafness genes.

Massively parallel sequencing (MPS) is a rapidly developing approach for genome analysis with increasing application in clinical practice. The purpose of this study was to use MPS for identification of aneuploidies and unbalanced chromosomal rearrangements after blastocyst biopsy. Trophectoderm (TE) samples of 38 blastocysts from 16 in vitro fertilization cycles were subjected to analysis. Low-coverage whole genome sequencing was performed using the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform with a novel algorithm purposely created for chromosomal analysis. The efficiency of this MPS approach was estimated by comparing results obtained by an Affymetrix single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. Whole genome amplification (WGA) products of TE cells were detected by MPS, with an average of 0.07x depth and 5.5% coverage of the human genome. Twenty-six embryos (68.4%) were detected as euploid, while six embryos (15.8%) contained uniform aneuploidies. Four of these (10.5%) were with solely unbalanced chromosomal rearrangements, whereas the remaining two embryos (5.3%) showed both aneuploidies and unbalanced rearrangements. Almost all these results were confirmed by the SNP array, with the exception of one sample, where different sizes of unbalanced rearrangements were detected, possibly due to chromosomal GC bias in array analysis. Our study demonstrated MPS could be applied to accurately detect embryonic chromosomal abnormality with a flexible and cost-effective strategy and higher potential accuracy.

Method A practical method Fetal Copy-number Analysis through Maternal Plasma Sequencing (FCAPS), integrated with GC-bias correction, binary segmentation algorithm and dynamic threshold strategy, was developed to detect fetal chromosomal deletions/duplications of >10Mb by low coverage whole genome sequencing (about 0.08-fold). The sensitivity/specificity of the resultant FCAPS algorithm in detecting deletions/duplications was firstly assessed in silico and then tested in 1311 maternal plasma samples from those with known G-banding karyotyping results of the fetus. Results Deletions/duplications, ranged from 9.01 to 28.46Mb, were suspected in four of the 1311 samples, of which three were consistent with the results of fetal karyotyping. In one case, the suspected abnormality was not confirmed by karyotyping, representing a false positive case. No false negative case was observed in the remaining 1307 low-risk samples. The sensitivity and specificity for detection of >10-Mb chromosomal deletions/duplications were100% and 99.92%, respectively. Conclusion Our study demonstrated FCAPS has the potential to detect fetal large deletions/duplications (>10Mb) with low coverage maternal plasma DNA sequencing currently used for fetal aneuploidy detection.

We reported here a case who had first trimester screening test for Down syndrome, chorionic villus sampling for fetal karyotyping, quantitative fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (QF-PCR), as well as non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) by maternal plasma sequencing. There were discordant results between fetal karyotyping and NIPT due to UPD 21combined with confined placental mosaicism of trisomy 21. This demonstrated that it is possible to detect placental mosaicism by NIPT, but further studies are required to confirm its sensitivity. Therefore, all positive NIPT results must be confirmed by conventional invasive test and karyotyping. QF-PCR has the additional benefit in diagnosing UPD. (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The major genetic alterations in sporadic insulinomas are still unknown. Here we identify recurrent somatic T372R mutations in YY1 by whole exome sequencing of 10 sporadic insulinomas. Further screening in 103 additional insulinomas reveals this hotspot mutation in 30% (34/113) of all tumours. T372R mutation alters the expression of YY1 target genes in insulinomas. Clinically, the T372R mutation is associated with the later onset of tumours. Genotyping of YY1, a target of mTOR inhibitors, may contribute to medical treatment of insulinomas. Our findings highlight the importance of YY1 in pancreatic beta-cells and may provide therapeutic targets for PNETs.

SOAPfuse applies an improved partial exhaustion algorithm to construct a library of fusion junction sequences, which can be used to efficiently identify fusion events, and employs a series of filters to nominate high-confidence fusion transcripts. Compared with other released tools, SOAPfuse achieves higher detection efficiency and consumed less computing resources. We applied SOAPfuse to RNA-Seq data from two bladder cancer cell lines, and confirmed 15 fusion transcripts, including several novel events common to both cell lines.

IBC 50K SNP Array BMI Consortium	Gene-centric meta-analyses of 108 912 individuals confirm known body mass index loci and reveal three novel signals	HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS			English	Article							GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; MELANOCORTIN-4 RECEPTOR; COMMON VARIANTS; EATING BEHAVIOR; OBESITY; POPULATION; DISEASE; ADIPOSITY; MC4R; POLYMORPHISMS	Recent genetic association studies have made progress in uncovering components of the genetic architecture of the body mass index (BMI). We used the ITMAT-Broad-Candidate Gene Association Resource (CARe) (IBC) array comprising up to 49 320 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across approximate to 2100 metabolic and cardiovascular-related loci to genotype up to 108 912 individuals of European ancestry (EA), African-Americans, Hispanics and East Asians, from 46 studies, to provide additional insight into SNPs underpinning BMI. We used a five-phase study design: Phase I focused on meta-analysis of EA studies providing individual level genotype data; Phase II performed a replication of cohorts providing summary level EA data; Phase III meta-analyzed results from the first two phases; associated SNPs from Phase III were used for replication in Phase IV; finally in Phase V, a multi-ethnic meta-analysis of all samples from four ethnicities was performed. At an array-wide significance (P 2.40E-06), we identify novel BMI associations in loci translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40 homolog (yeast) - apolipoprotein E - apolipoprotein C-I (TOMM40-APOE-APOC1) (rs2075650, P 2.95E-10), sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 2 (SREBF2, rs5996074, P 9.43E-07) and neurotrophic tyrosine kinase, receptor, type 2 [NTRK2, a brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) receptor gene, rs1211166, P 1.04E-06] in the Phase IV meta-analysis. Of 10 loci with previous evidence for BMI association represented on the IBC array, eight were replicated, with the remaining two showing nominal significance. Conditional analyses revealed two independent BMI-associated signals in BDNF and melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) regions. Of the 11 array-wide significant SNPs, three are associated with gene expression levels in both primary B-cells and monocytes; with rs4788099 in SH2B adaptor protein 1 (SH2B1) notably being associated with the expression of multiple genes in cis. These multi-ethnic meta-analyses expand our knowledge of BMI genetics.

To enable basic and applied research of this important pest, we sequenced the D. suzukii genome to obtain a high-quality reference sequence. Here, we discuss the basic properties of the genome and transcriptome and describe patterns of genome evolution in D. suzukii and its close relatives. Our analyses and genome annotations are presented in a web portal, SpottedWingFlyBase, to facilitate public access.

Whole-Genome Sequencing Uncovers the Genetic Basis of Chronic Mountain Sickness in Andean Highlanders	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article							HIGH-ALTITUDE HYPOXIA; DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER; HUMAN ADAPTATION; GOLDEN BUG; POPULATIONS; PATTERNS; TIBETAN; OXYGEN; MODEL; ERYTHROPOIESIS	The hypoxic conditions at high altitudes present a challenge for survival, causing pressure for adaptation. Interestingly, many high-altitude denizens (particularly in the Andes) are maladapted, with a condition known as chronic mountain sickness (CMS) or Monge disease. To decode the genetic basis of this disease, we sequenced and compared the whole genomes of 20 Andean subjects (10 with CMS and 10 without). We discovered 11 regions genome-wide with significant differences in haplotype frequencies consistent with selective sweeps. In these regions, two genes (an erythropoiesis regulator, SENP1, and an oncogene, ANP32D) had a higher transcriptional response to hypoxia in individuals with CMS relative to those without. We further found that downregulating the orthologs of these genes in flies dramatically enhanced survival rates under hypoxia, demonstrating that suppression of SENP1 and ANP32D plays an essential role in hypoxia tolerance. Our study provides an unbiased framework to identify and validate the genetic basis of adaptation to high altitudes and identifies potentially targetable mechanisms for CMS treatment.

SOAP3-dp, through leveraging the computational power of both CPU and GPU with optimized algorithms, delivers high speed and sensitivity simultaneously. Compared with widely adopted aligners including BWA, Bowtie2, SeqAlto, CUSHAW2, GEM and GPU-based aligners BarraCUDA and CUSHAW, SOAP3-dp was found to be two to tens of times faster, while maintaining the highest sensitivity and lowest false discovery rate (FDR) on Illumina reads with different lengths. Transcending its predecessor SOAP3, which does not allow gapped alignment, SOAP3-dp by default tolerates alignment similarity as low as 60%. Real data evaluation using human genome demonstrates SOAP3-dp's power to enable more authentic variants and longer Indels to be discovered. Fosmid sequencing shows a 9.1% FDR on newly discovered deletions. SOAP3-dp natively supports BAM file format and provides the same scoring scheme as BWA, which enables it to be integrated into existing analysis pipelines. SOAP3-dp has been deployed on Amazon-EC2, NIH-Biowulf and Tianhe-1A.

We assign all unmapped reads with a mapped partner to their expected genomic positions and then perform extensive de novo assembly on the regions with many unmapped reads to resolve homozygous, heterozygous, and complex indels by exhaustive traversal of the de Bruijn graph. The method is implemented in the software SOAPindel and provides a list of candidate indels with quality scores. We compare SOAPindel to Dindel, Pindel, and GATK on simulated data and find similar or better performance for short indels (<10 bp) and higher sensitivity and specificity for long indels. A validation experiment suggests that SOAPindel has a false-positive rate of similar to 10% for long indels (>5 bp), while still providing many more candidate indels than other approaches.

A resource of genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms generated by RAD tag sequencing in the critically endangered European eel	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES			English	Article						effective population size; population genomics; RAD sequencing; SNP discovery	POPULATION HISTORY; ANGUILLA-ROSTRATA; LOCAL ADAPTATION; DNA-SEQUENCES; SNP DISCOVERY; SARGASSO SEA; DE-NOVO; MARKERS; MICROSATELLITES; RECRUITMENT	Reduced representation genome sequencing such as restriction-site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing is finding increased use to identify and genotype large numbers of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in model and nonmodel species. We generated a unique resource of novel SNP markers for the European eel using the RAD sequencing approach that was simultaneously identified and scored in a genome-wide scan of 30 individuals. Whereas genomic resources are increasingly becoming available for this species, including the recent release of a draft genome, no genome-wide set of SNP markers was available until now. The generated SNPs were widely distributed across the eel genome, aligning to 4779 different contigs and 19703 different scaffolds. Significant variation was identified, with an average nucleotide diversity of 0.00529 across individuals. Results varied widely across the genome, ranging from 0.00048 to 0.00737 per locus. Based on the average nucleotide diversity across all loci, long-term effective population size was estimated to range between 132000 and 1320000, which is much higher than previous estimates based on microsatellite loci. The generated SNP resource consisting of 82425 loci and 376918 associated SNPs provides a valuable tool for future population genetics and genomics studies and allows for targeting specific genes and particularly interesting regions of the eel genome.

They comprise a sister lineage of birds and have no sex chromosome. Here we report the genome sequence of the endangered Chinese alligator (Alligator sinensis) and describe its unique features. The next-generation sequencing generated 314 Gb of raw sequence, yielding a genome size of 2.3 Gb. A total of 22 200 genes were predicted in Alligator sinensis using a de novo, homology-and RNA-based combined model. The genetic basis of long-diving behavior includes duplication of the bicarbonate-binding hemoglobin gene, co-functioning of routine phosphate-binding and special bicarbonate-binding oxygen transport, and positively selected energy metabolism, ammonium bicarbonate excretion and cardiac muscle contraction. Further, we elucidated the robust Alligator sinensis sensory system, including a significantly expanded olfactory receptor repertoire, rapidly evolving nerve-related cellular components and visual perception, and positive selection of the night vision-related opsin and sound detection-associated otopetrin. We also discovered a well-developed immune system with a considerable number of lineage-specific antigen-presentation genes for adaptive immunity as well as expansion of the tripartite motif-containing C-type lectin and butyrophilin genes for innate immunity and expression of antibacterial peptides. Multifluorescence in situ hybridization showed that alligator chromosome 3, which encodes DMRT1, exhibits significant synteny with chicken chromosome Z. Finally, population history analysis indicated population admixture 0.60-1.05 million years ago, when the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau was uplifted.

For every sample, it was processed, sequenced and reported as soon as it was collected as other clinical samples for singleton pregnancies. The NIFTY test was negative in the 11 pregnancies carried normal fetuses, and was positive (high risk) in the case with discordant fetal Trisomy 21. The sensitivity and specificity were both 100%. This small case series suggested the NIFTY as a screening test for fetal Trisomy 21 is feasible in twin pregnancies.

By using whole-exome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and targeted sequencing, we investigated germline and tumor DNA in individuals from four distinct families with the familial form of IM and in five simplex IM cases with no previous family history of this disease. We identified a germline mutation c.1681C>T (p.Arg561Cys) in platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRB) in all 11 affected individuals with familial IM, although none of the five individuals with nonfamilial IM had mutations in this gene. We further identified a second heterozygous mutation in PDGFRB in two myofibromas from one of the affected familial cases, indicative of a potential second hit in this gene in the tumor. PDGFR-beta promotes growth of mesenchymal cells, including blood vessels and smooth muscles, which are affected in W. Our findings indicate p.Arg561Cys substitution in PDGFR:13 as a cause of the dominant form of this disease. They provide a rationale for further investigations of this specific mutation and gene to assess the benefits of targeted therapies against PDGFR-beta in aggressive life-threatening familial forms of the disease.

Cyclotide Discovery in Gentianales Revisited-Identification and Characterization of Cyclic Cystine-Knot Peptides and Their Phylogenetic Distribution in Rubiaceae Plants	BIOPOLYMERS			English	Article						cyclotides; peptidomics; transcriptomics; ipecac; Rubiaceae; Carapichea; Notopleura; Psychotrieae; Palicoureeae	OLDENLANDIA-AFFINIS; CIRCULAR PROTEINS; CYCLOVIOLACIN O2; FLOWERING PLANTS; DRUG DESIGN; KALATA B1; PSYCHOTRIA; BIOSYNTHESIS; EXPRESSION; CLASSIFICATION	Cyclotides are a unique class of ribosomally synthesized cysteine-rich miniproteins characterized by a head-to-tail cyclized backbone and three conserved disulfide-bonds in a knotted arrangement. Originally they were discovered in the coffee-family plant Oldenlandia affinis (Rubiaceae) and have since been identified in several species of the violet, cucurbit, pea, potato, and grass families. However, the identification of novel cyclotide-containing plant species still is a major challenge due to the lack of a rapid and accurate analytical workflow in particular for large sampling numbers. As a consequence, their phylogeny in the plant kingdom remains unclear. To gain further insight into the distribution and evolution of plant cyclotides, we analyzed similar to 300 species of > 40 different families, with special emphasis on plants from the order Gentianales. For this purpose, we have developed a refined screening methodology combining chemical analysis of plant extracts and bioinformatic analysis of transcript databases. Using mass spectrometry and transcriptome-mining, we identified nine novel cyclotide-containing species and their related cyclotide precursor genes in the tribe Palicoureeae. The characterization of novel peptide sequences underlines the high variability and plasticity of the cyclotide framework, and a comparison of novel precursor proteins from Carapichea ipecacuanha illustrated their typical cyclotide gene architectures. Phylogenetic analysis of their distribution within the Psychotria alliance revealed cyclotides to be restricted to Palicourea, Margaritopsis, Notopleura, Carapichea, Chassalia, and Geophila. In line with previous reports, our findings confirm cyclotides to be one of the largest peptide families within the plant kingdom and suggest that their total number may exceed tens of thousands.

Nonpulmonary anomalies involving organs of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and genitourinary systems have been identified in approximately 80% of patients with ACD/MPV. We have collected DNA and pathological samples from more than 90 infants with ACD/MPV and their family members. Since the publication of our initial report of four point mutations and 10 deletions, we have identified an additional 38 novel nonsynonymous mutations of FOXF1 (nine nonsense, seven frameshift, one inframe deletion, 20 missense, and one no stop). This report represents an up to date list of all known FOXF1 mutations to the best of our knowledge. Majority of the cases are sporadic. We report four familial cases of which three show maternal inheritance, consistent with paternal imprinting of the gene. Twenty five mutations (60%) are located within the putative DNA-binding domain, indicating its plausible role in FOXF1 function. Five mutations map to the second exon. We identified two additional genic and eight genomic deletions upstream to FOXF1. These results corroborate and extend our previous observations and further establish involvement of FOXF1 in ACD/MPV and lung organogenesis.

The draft genome of a socially polymorphic halictid bee, Lasioglossum albipes	GENOME BIOLOGY			English	Article							ANTS CAMPONOTUS-FLORIDANUS; DNA METHYLATION; PHYLOGENETIC INFERENCE; HARPEGNATHOS-SALTATOR; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; ADAPTIVE EVOLUTION; EUSOCIAL NESTS; HONEY-BEES; GENE; FAMILY	Background: Taxa that harbor natural phenotypic variation are ideal for ecological genomic approaches aimed at understanding how the interplay between genetic and environmental factors can lead to the evolution of complex traits. Lasioglossum albipes is a polymorphic halictid bee that expresses variation in social behavior among populations, and common-garden experiments have suggested that this variation is likely to have a genetic component. Results: We present the L. albipes genome assembly to characterize the genetic and ecological factors associated with the evolution of social behavior. The de novo assembly is comparable to other published social insect genomes, with an N50 scaffold length of 602 kb. Gene families unique to L. albipes are associated with integrin-mediated signaling and DNA-binding domains, and several appear to be expanded in this species, including the glutathione-s-transferases and the inositol monophosphatases. L. albipes has an intact DNA methylation system, and in silico analyses suggest that methylation occurs primarily in exons. Comparisons to other insect genomes indicate that genes associated with metabolism and nucleotide binding undergo accelerated evolution in the halictid lineage. Whole-genome resequencing data from one solitary and one social L. albipes female identify six genes that appear to be rapidly diverging between social forms, including a putative odorant receptor and a cuticular protein. Conclusions: L. albipes represents a novel genetic model system for understanding the evolution of social behavior. It represents the first published genome sequence of a primitively social insect, thereby facilitating comparative genomic studies across the Hymenoptera as a whole.

It requires at least 10% NaCl and thrives in saturated salt solution. To investigate the genomic basis of this exceptional phenotype, we obtained a de-novo genome sequence of the species type-strain and analysed its transcriptomic response to conditions close to the limits of its lower and upper salinity range. Results: The unusually compact genome is 9.6 Mb large and contains 1.67% repetitive sequences. Only 4884 predicted protein coding genes cover almost three quarters of the sequence. Of 639 differentially expressed genes, two thirds are more expressed at lower salinity. Phylogenomic analysis based on the largest dataset used to date (whole proteomes) positions Wallemiomycetes as a 250-million-year-old sister group of Agaricomycotina. Contrary to the closely related species Wallemia sebi, W. ichthyophaga appears to have lost the ability for sexual reproduction. Several protein families are significantly expanded or contracted in the genome. Among these, there are the P-type ATPase cation transporters, but not the sodium/hydrogen exchanger family. Transcription of all but three cation transporters is not salt dependent. The analysis also reveals a significant enrichment in hydrophobins, which are cell-wall proteins with multiple cellular functions. Half of these are differentially expressed, and most contain an unusually large number of acidic amino acids. This discovery is of particular interest due to the numerous applications of hydrophobines from other fungi in industry, pharmaceutics and medicine. Conclusions: W. ichthyophaga is an extremophilic specialist that shows only low levels of adaptability and genetic recombination. This is reflected in the characteristics of its genome and its transcriptomic response to salt. No unusual traits were observed in common salt-tolerance mechanisms, such as transport of inorganic ions or synthesis of compatible solutes. Instead, various data indicate a role of the cell wall of W. ichthyophaga in its response to salt. Availability of the genomic sequence is expected to facilitate further research into this unique species, and shed more light on adaptations that allow it to thrive in conditions lethal to most other eukaryotes.

However, in avian species like the ground tit Pseudopodoces humilis, the adaptation mechanism remains unclear. The phylogeny of the ground tit is also controversial. Results: Using next generation sequencing technology, we generated and assembled a draft genome sequence of the ground tit. The assembly contained 1.04 Gb of sequence that covered 95.4% of the whole genome and had higher N50 values, at the level of both scaffolds and contigs, than other sequenced avian genomes. About 1.7 million SNPs were detected, 16,998 protein-coding genes were predicted and 7% of the genome was identified as repeat sequences. Comparisons between the ground tit genome and other avian genomes revealed a conserved genome structure and confirmed the phylogeny of ground tit as not belonging to the Corvidae family. Gene family expansion and positively selected gene analysis revealed genes that were related to cardiac function. Our findings contribute to our understanding of the adaptation of this species to extreme environmental living conditions. Conclusions: Our data and analysis contribute to the study of avian evolutionary history and provide new insights into the adaptation mechanisms to extreme conditions in animals.

Their failure is postulated to promote genomic instability and malignant transformation in B cells. By performing targeted sequencing of 73 key DNA repair genes in 29 B cell lymphoma samples, somatic and germline mutations were identified in various DNA repair pathways, mainly in diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCLs). Mutations in mismatch repair genes (EXO1, MSH2, and MSH6) were associated with microsatellite instability, increased number of somatic insertions/deletions, and altered mutation signatures in tumors. Somatic mutations in nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) genes (DCLRE1C/ARTEMIS, PRKDC/DNA-PKcs, XRCC5/KU80, and XRCC6/KU70) were identified in four DLBCL tumors and cytogenetic analyses revealed that translocations involving the immunoglobulin-heavy chain locus occurred exclusively in NHEJ-mutated samples. The novel mutation targets, CHEK2 and PARP1, were further screened in expanded DLBCL cohorts, and somatic as well as novel and rare germline mutations were identified in 8 and 5% of analyzed tumors, respectively. By correlating defects in a subset of DNA damage response and repair genes with genomic instability events in tumors, we propose that these genes play a role in DLBCL lymphomagenesis.

Here we report a high-quality draft genome and three re-sequenced genomes of L. vexillifer using Illumina short-read sequencing technology. Comparative genomic analyses reveal that cetaceans have a slow molecular clock and molecular adaptations to their aquatic lifestyle. We also find a significantly lower number of heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms in the baiji compared to all other mammalian genomes reported thus far. A reconstruction of the demographic history of the baiji indicates that a bottleneck occurred near the end of the last deglaciation, a time coinciding with a rapid decrease in temperature and the rise of eustatic sea level.

Next-generation sequencing now offers access to protein coding sequences very easily, quickly and cost-effectively. To improve upon earlier work, we extracted 417 orthologous single-copy nuclear genes from the transcriptomes of 15 species of the Vitaceae, covering its phylogenetic diversity. The resulting transcriptome phylogeny provides robust support for the deep relationships, showing the phylogenetic utility of transcriptome data for plants over a time scale at least since the mid-Cretaceous. The pros and cons of transcriptome data for phylogenetic inference in plants are also evaluated.

Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is a genetically heterogeneous disease with, to date, 19 identified causative genes. Our aim was to evaluate the mutations in all 19 genes in Chinese families with LCA. METHODS. LCA patients from 41 unrelated Chinese families were enrolled, including 25 previously unanalyzed families and 16 families screened previously by Sanger sequencing, but with no identified mutations. Genetic variations were screened by whole-exome sequencing and then validated using Sanger sequencing. RESULTS. A total of 41 variants predicted to affect protein coding or splicing was detected by whole-exome sequencing, and 40 were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Bioinformatic and segregation analyses revealed 22 potentially pathogenic variants (17 novel) in 15 probands, comprised of 3 of 16 previously analyzed families and 12 of 25 (48%) previously unanalyzed families. In the latter 12 families, mutations were found in CEP290 (three probands); GUCY2D (two probands); and CRB1, CRX, RPE65, IQCB1, LCA5, TULP1, and IMPDH1 (one proband each). Based on the results from 87 previously analyzed probands and 25 new cases, GUCY2D, CRB1, RPGRIP1, CEP290, and CRX were the five most frequently mutated genes, which was similar to the results from studies in Caucasian subjects. CONCLUSIONS. Whole-exome sequencing detected mutations in the 19 known LCA genes in approximately half of Chinese families with LCA. These results, together with our previous results, demonstrate the spectrum and frequency of mutations of the 19 genes responsible for LCA in Han Chinese individuals. Whole-exome sequencing is an efficient method for detecting mutations in highly heterogeneous hereditary diseases.

Previous exome sequencing studies on family trios have implicated a role for rare, de-novo mutations in the pathogenesis of autism. Methods: To examine the utility of whole-genome sequencing to identify inherited disease candidate variants and genes, we sequenced two probands from a large pedigree, including two parents and eight children. We evaluated multiple analytical strategies to identify a prioritized list of candidate genes. Results: By assuming a recessive model of inheritance, we identified seven candidate genes shared by the two probands. We also evaluated a different analytical strategy that does not require the assumption of disease model, and identified a list of 59 candidate variants that may increase susceptibility to autism. Manual examination of this list identified ANK3 as the most likely candidate gene. Finally, we identified 33 prioritized non-coding variants such as those near SMG6 and COQ5, based on evolutionary constraint and experimental evidence from ENCODE. Although we were unable to confirm rigorously whether any of these genes indeed contribute to the disease, our analysis provides a prioritized shortlist for further validation studies. Conclusions: Our study represents one of the first whole-genome sequencing studies in autism leveraging a large family-based pedigree. These results provide for a discussion on the relative merits of finding de-novo mutations in sporadic cases versus finding inherited mutations in large pedigrees, in the context of neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental diseases.

They are also known as the basis of the popular natural animal food addictive in Europe. However, few studies especially at genomics level were conducted on them. Hence, we performed the Macleaya spp. transcriptome and integrated it with iTRAQ proteome analysis in order to identify potential genes involved in alkaloids biosynthesis. Methodology and Principal Findings: We elaborately designed the transcriptome, proteome and metabolism profiling for 10 samples of both species to explore their alkaloids biosynthesis. From the transcriptome data, we obtained 69367 and 78255 unigenes for M. cordata and M. microcarpa, in which about two thirds of them were similar to sequences in public databases. By metabolism profiling, reverse patterns for alkaloids sanguinarine, chelerythrine, protopine, and allocryptopine were observed in different organs of two species. We characterized the expressions of enzymes in alkaloid biosynthesis pathways. We also identified more than 1000 proteins from iTRAQ proteome data. Our results strongly suggest that the root maybe the organ for major alkaloids biosynthesis of Macleaya spp. Except for biosynthesis, the alkaloids storage and transport were also important for their accumulation. The ultrastructure of laticifers by SEM helps us to prove the alkaloids maybe accumulated in the mature roots. Conclusions/Significance: To our knowledge this is the first study to elucidate the genetic makeup of Macleaya spp. This work provides clues to the identification of the potential modulate genes involved in alkaloids biosynthesis in Macleaya spp., and sheds light on researches for non-model medicinal plants by integrating different high-throughput technologies.

This method could be improved to generate a more comprehensive representation. Results: Based on in silico simulation of enzyme digestion of human and mouse genomes, we have optimized the current single-enzyme RRBS by applying double enzyme digestion in the library construction to interrogate more representative regions. CpG coverage of genomic regions was considerably increased in both high-CG and low-CG regions using the double-enzyme RRBS method, leading to more accurate detection of their average methylation levels and identification of differential methylation regions between samples. We also applied this double-enzyme RRBS method to comprehensively analyze the CpG methylation profiles of two colorectal cancer cell lines. Conclusion: The double-enzyme RRBS increases the CpG coverage of genomic regions considerably over the previous single-enzyme RRBS method, leading to more accurate detection of their average methylation levels. It will facilitate genome-wide DNA methylation studies in multiple and complex clinical samples.

Transcriptome-Mining for Single-Copy Nuclear Markers in Ferns	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; ADIANTUM-CAPILLUS-VENERIS; RBCL GENE-SEQUENCES; EUPOLYPOD II FERNS; PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; DRYOPTERIS DRYOPTERIDACEAE; MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; CHLOROPLAST DNA; NUCLEOTIDE-SEQUENCES; TRNL-F	Background: Molecular phylogenetic investigations have revolutionized our understanding of the evolutionary history of ferns-the second-most species-rich major group of vascular plants, and the sister clade to seed plants. The general absence of genomic resources available for this important group of plants, however, has resulted in the strong dependence of these studies on plastid data; nuclear or mitochondrial data have been rarely used. In this study, we utilize transcriptome data to design primers for nuclear markers for use in studies of fern evolutionary biology, and demonstrate the utility of these markers across the largest order of ferns, the Polypodiales. Principal Findings: We present 20 novel single-copy nuclear regions, across 10 distinct protein-coding genes: ApPEFP_C, cryptochrome 2, cryptochrome 4, DET1, gapCpSh, IBR3, pgiC, SQD1, TPLATE, and transducin. These loci, individually and in combination, show strong resolving power across the Polypodiales phylogeny, and are readily amplified and sequenced from our genomic DNA test set (from 15 diploid Polypodiales species). For each region, we also present transcriptome alignments of the focal locus and related paralogs-curated broadly across ferns-that will allow researchers to develop their own primer sets for fern taxa outside of the Polypodiales. Analyses of sequence data generated from our genomic DNA test set reveal strong effects of partitioning schemes on support levels and, to a much lesser extent, on topology. A model partitioned by codon position is strongly favored, and analyses of the combined data yield a Polypodiales phylogeny that is well-supported and consistent with earlier studies of this group. Conclusions: The 20 single-copy regions presented here more than triple the single-copy nuclear regions available for use in ferns. They provide a much-needed opportunity to assess plastid-derived hypotheses of relationships within the ferns, and increase our capacity to explore aspects of fern evolution previously unavailable to scientific investigation.

Specificity and Function of Archaeal DNA Replication Initiator Proteins	CELL REPORTS			English	Article							SULFOLOBUS-SOLFATARICUS; CHROMOSOME-REPLICATION; ORIGIN RECOGNITION; STRUCTURAL BASIS; CELL-CYCLE; IN-VITRO; COMPLEX; TRANSCRIPTION; TERMINATION; GENOME	Chromosomes with multiple DNA replication origins are a hallmark of Eukaryotes and some Archaea. All eukaryal nuclear replication origins are defined by the origin recognition complex (ORC) that recruits the replicative helicase MCM(2-7) via Cdc6 and Cdt1. We find that the three origins in the single chromosome of the archaeon Sulfolobus islandicus are specified by distinct initiation factors. While two origins are dependent on archaeal homologs of eukaryal Orc1 and Cdc6, the third origin is instead reliant on an archaeal Cdt1 homolog. We exploit the nonessential nature of the orc1-1 gene to investigate the role of ATP binding and hydrolysis in initiator function in vivo and in vitro. We find that the ATP-bound form of Orc1-1 is proficient for replication and implicates hydrolysis of ATP in downregulation of origin activity. Finally, we reveal that ATP and DNA binding by Orc1-1 remodels the protein's structure rather than that of the DNA template.

Transcriptional Reprogramming of Wheat and the Hemibiotrophic Pathogen Septoria tritici during Two Phases of the Compatible Interaction	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FUNGUS MYCOSPHAERELLA-GRAMINICOLA; PROGRAMMED CELL-DEATH; RNA-SEQ DATA; PHYTOPHTHORA-INFESTANS; FUSARIUM-GRAMINEARUM; HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE; PROTEIN; EXPRESSION; BARLEY; HOST	The disease septoria leaf blotch of wheat, caused by fungal pathogen Septoria tritici, is of worldwide concern. The fungus exhibits a hemibiotrophic lifestyle, with a long symptomless, biotrophic phase followed by a sudden transition to necrotrophy associated with host necrosis. Little is known about the systematic interaction between fungal pathogenicity and host responses at specific growth stages and the factors triggering the transition. In order to gain some insights into global transcriptome alterations in both host and pathogen during the two phases of the compatible interaction, disease transition was monitored using pathogenesis-related gene markers and H2O2 signature prior to RNA-Seq. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the slow symptomless growth was accompanied by minor metabolic responses and slightly suppressed defences in the host, whereas necrotrophic growth was associated with enhanced host responses involving energy metabolism, transport, signalling, defence and oxidative stress as well as a decrease in photosynthesis. The fungus expresses distinct classes of stage-specific genes encoding potential effectors, probably first suppressing plant defence responses/facilitating the symptomless growth and later triggering life style transition and inducing host necrosis/facilitating the necrotrophic growth. Transport, signalling, anti-oxidative stress mechanisms and apoplastic nutrient acquisition play important roles in the entire infection process of S. tritici. Our findings uncover systematic S. tritici-induced expression profiles of wheat related to specific fungal infection strategies and provide a transcriptome resource for studying both hosts and pathogens in plant-Dothideomycete interactions.

Recent progress in proteomics permits a thorough characterization of the mechanisms associated with critical illness. The purpose of this study was to screen potential biomarkers for early prognostic assessment of patients with sepsis. Methods: For the discovery stage, 30 sepsis patients with different prognoses were selected. Urinary proteins were identified using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) coupled with LC-MS/ MS. Mass spec instrument analysis were performed with Mascot software and the International Protein Index (IPI); bioinformatic analyses were used by the algorithm of set and the Gene Ontology (GO) Database. For the verification stage, the study involved another 54 sepsis-hospitalized patients, with equal numbers of patients in survivor and non-survivor groups based on 28-day survival. Differentially expressed proteins were verified by Western Blot. Results: A total of 232 unique proteins were identified. Proteins that were differentially expressed were further analyzed based on the pathophysiology of sepsis and biomathematics. For sepsis prognosis, five proteins were significantly up-regulated: selenium binding protein-1, heparan sulfate proteoglycan-2, alpha-1-B glycoprotein, haptoglobin, and lipocalin; two proteins were significantly down-regulated: lysosome-associated membrane proteins-1 and dipeptidyl peptidase-4. Based on gene ontology clustering, these proteins were associated with the biological processes of lipid homeostasis, cartilage development, iron ion transport, and certain metabolic processes. Urinary LAMP-1 was down-regulated, consistent with the Western Blot validation. Conclusion: This study provides the proteomic analysis of urine to identify prognostic biomarkers of sepsis. The seven identified proteins provide insight into the mechanism of sepsis. Low urinary LAMP-1 levels may be useful for early prognostic assessment of sepsis.

This mutualism arose approximately 75 million years ago. Unlike many other intimate symbioses, which involve vertical transmission of symbionts to host offspring, female fig wasps fly great distances to transfer horizontally between hosts. In contrast, male wasps are wingless and cannot disperse. Symbionts that keep intimate contact with their hosts often show genome reduction, but it is not clear if the wide dispersal of female fig wasps will counteract this general tendency. We sequenced the genome of the fig wasp Ceratosolen solmsi to address this question. Results: The genome size of the fig wasp C. solmsi is typical of insects, but has undergone dramatic reductions of gene families involved in environmental sensing and detoxification. The streamlined chemosensory ability reflects the overwhelming importance of females finding trees of their only host species, Ficus hispida, during their fleeting adult lives. Despite long-distance dispersal, little need exists for detoxification or environmental protection because fig wasps spend nearly all of their lives inside a largely benign host. Analyses of transcriptomes in females and males at four key life stages reveal that the extreme anatomical sexual dimorphism of fig wasps may result from a strong bias in sex-differential gene expression. Conclusions: Our comparison of the C. solmsi genome with other insects provides new insights into the evolution of obligate mutualism. The draft genome of the fig wasp, and transcriptomic comparisons between both sexes at four different life stages, provide insights into the molecular basis for the extreme anatomical sexual dimorphism of this species.

Recently, sequencing approaches have allowed analysis of low frequency and rare variants in conjunction with common variants, thereby improving the search for functional variants and thus the understanding of the underlying biology of human traits and diseases. Here, we used a large Icelandic whole genome sequence dataset combined with Danish exome sequence data to gain insight into the genetic architecture of serum levels of vitamin B-12 (B-12) and folate. Up to 22.9 million sequence variants were analyzed in combined samples of 45,576 and 37,341 individuals with serum B-12 and folate measurements, respectively. We found six novel loci associating with serum B-12 (CD320, TCN2, ABCD4, MMAA, MMACHC) or folate levels (FOLR3) and confirmed seven loci for these traits (TCN1, FUT6, FUT2, CUBN, CLYBL, MUT, MTHFR). Conditional analyses established that four loci contain additional independent signals. Interestingly, 13 of the 18 identified variants were coding and 11 of the 13 target genes have known functions related to B-12 and folate pathways. Contrary to epidemiological studies we did not find consistent association of the variants with cardiovascular diseases, cancers or Alzheimer's disease although some variants demonstrated pleiotropic effects. Although to some degree impeded by low statistical power for some of these conditions, these data suggest that sequence variants that contribute to the population diversity in serum B-12 or folate levels do not modify the risk of developing these conditions. Yet, the study demonstrates the value of combining whole genome and exome sequencing approaches to ascertain the genetic and molecular architectures underlying quantitative trait associations.

To explore the relevant molecular events, we used the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) coupled with the shotgun proteomics technique (iTRAQ/Shotgun) to study the proteomic changes of rice embryos during embryogenesis. For the first time, a total of 2 165 unique proteins were identified in rice embryos, and the abundances of 867 proteins were actively changed based on the statistical evaluation of the quantitative MS/MS signals. The quantitative data were then confirmed using multiple reactions monitoring (MRM) and were also supported by our previous study based on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 DE). Using the proteome at 6 days after pollination (DAP) as a reference, cluster analysis of these differential proteins throughout rice embryogenesis revealed that 25% were up-regulated and 75% were down-regulated. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis implicated that most of the up-regulated proteins were functionally categorized as stress responsive, mainly including heat shock-, lipid transfer-, and reactive oxygen species-related proteins. The stress-responsive proteins were thus postulated to play an important role during seed maturation.

RNA and DNA libraries were sequenced from plasma filtrates enriched in viral particles to catalog virus populations. Hepatitis viruses were readily detected at high coverage in patients with chronic viral hepatitis B and C, but only a limited number of sequences resembling other viruses were found. The exception was a library from a patient diagnosed with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection that contained multiple sequences matching GB virus C (GBV-C). Abundant GBV-C reads were also found in plasma from patients with AIH, whereas Torque teno virus (TTV) was found at high frequency in samples from patients with AIH and NASH. After taxonomic classification of sequences by BLASTn, a substantial fraction in each library, ranging from 35% to 76%, remained unclassified. These unknown sequences were assembled into scaffolds along with virus, phage and endogenous retrovirus sequences and then analyzed by BLASTx against the non-redundant protein database. Nearly the full genome of a heretofore-unknown circovirus was assembled and many scaffolds that encoded proteins with similarity to plant, insect and mammalian viruses. The presence of this novel circovirus was confirmed by PCR. BLASTx also identified many polypeptides resembling nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDV) proteins. We re-evaluated these alignments with a profile hidden Markov method, HHblits, and observed inconsistencies in the target proteins reported by the different algorithms. This suggests that sequence alignments are insufficient to identify NCLDV proteins, especially when these alignments are only to small portions of the target protein. Nevertheless, we have now established a reliable protocol for the identification of viruses in plasma that can also be adapted to other patient samples such as urine, bile, saliva and other body fluids.

A major cause of early attrition is the demonstration of safety signals which can negate any therapeutic index previously established. Safety attrition needs to be put in context of clinical translation (i.e. human relevance) and is negatively impacted by differences between animal models and human. In order to minimize such an impact, an earlier assessment of pharmacological target homology across animal model species will enhance understanding of the context of animal safety signals and aid species selection during later regulatory toxicology studies. Here we sequenced the genomes of the Sus scrofa Gottingen minipig and the Canis familiaris beagle, two widely used animal species in regulatory safety studies. Comparative analyses of these new genomes with other key model organisms, namely mouse, rat, cynomolgus macaque, rhesus macaque, two related breeds (S. scrofa Duroc and C. familiaris boxer) and human reveal considerable variation in gene content. Key genes in toxicology and metabolism studies, such as the UGT2 family, CYP2D6, and SLCO1A2, displayed unique duplication patterns. Comparisons of 317 known human drug targets revealed surprising variation such as species-specific positive selection, duplication and higher occurrences of pseudogenized targets in beagle (41 genes) relative to minipig (19 genes). These data will facilitate the more effective use of animals in biomedical research. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

No causative genes have been reported to date. In this study, we investigated a large five-generation Chinese family with DUH. After excluding the two known DUH loci, we performed genome-wide linkage analysis and identified a DUH locus on chromosome 2q33.3-q36.1 with a maximum LOD score of 3.49 with marker D2S2382. Exome sequencing identified a c.1067T>C (p.Leu356Pro) mutation in exon 3 of ABCB6 (ATP-binding cassette subfamily B, member 6) in the DUH family. Two additional missense mutations, c.508A>G (p.Ser170Gly) in exon 1 and c.1736G>A (p.Gly579Glu) in exon 12 of ABCB6, were found in two out of six patients by mutational screening using sporadic DUH patients. Immunohistologic examination in biopsy specimens showed that ABCB6 is expressed in the epidermis and had a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution. Examination of subcellular localization of wild-type ABCB6 in a B16 mouse melanoma cell line revealed that it is localized to the endosome-like compartment and dendrite tips, whereas disease-causing mutations of ABCB6 resulted in its retention in the Golgi apparatus. Our studies identified ABCB6 as the first pathogenic gene associated with DUH. These findings suggest that ABCB6 may be a physiological factor for skin pigmentation.

A recent study identified de novo mutations causing constitutive activation of TRPV3 as a cause of the keratotic manifestations of Olmsted syndrome. Methods: Genetic, clinical and immunological profiling was performed on a case study patient with the clinical diagnosis of Olmsted syndrome. Results: The patient was found to harbour a previously undescribed 1718G-C transversion in TRPV3, causing a G573A point mutation. In depth clinical and immunological analysis found multiple indicators of immune dysregulation, including frequent dermal infections, inflammatory infiltrate in the affected skin, hyper IgE production and elevated follicular T cells and eosinophils in the peripheral blood. Conclusions: These results provide the first comprehensive assessment of the immunological features of Olmsted syndrome. The systemic phenotype of hyper IgE and persistent eosinophilia suggest a primary or secondary role of immunological processes in the pathogenesis of Olmsted syndrome, and have important clinical consequences with regard to the treatment of Olmsted syndrome patients.

Sequencing, Annotation, and Characterization of the Influenza Ferret Infectome	JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY			English	Article							2009 PANDEMIC INFLUENZA; A VIRUS-INFECTION; H1N1 VIRUS; IMMUNE-RESPONSES; DENDRITIC CELLS; RNA-SEQ; CHEMOKINES; CARNIVORA; VACCINES; DEFENSE	Ferrets have become an indispensable tool in the understanding of influenza virus virulence and pathogenesis. Furthermore, ferrets are the preferred preclinical model for influenza vaccine and therapeutic testing. Here we characterized the influenza infectome during the different stages of the infectious process in ferrets with and without prior specific immunity to influenza. RNA from lung tissue and lymph nodes from infected and naive animals was subjected to next-generation sequencing, followed by de novo data assembly and annotation of the resulting sequences; this process generated a library comprising 13,202 ferret mRNAs. Gene expression profiles during pandemic H1N1 (pdmH1N1) influenza virus infection were analyzed by digital gene expression and solid support microarrays. As expected during primary infection, innate immune responses were triggered in the lung tissue; meanwhile, in the lymphoid tissue, genes encoding antigen presentation and maturation of effector cells of adaptive immunity increased dramatically. After 5 days postinfection, the innate immune gene expression was replaced by the adaptive immune response, which correlates with viral clearance. Reinfection with homologous pandemic influenza virus resulted in a diminished innate immune response, early adaptive immune gene regulation, and a reduction in clinical severity.

In order to investigate the pathogens responsible for this outbreak and characterize their genetic characteristics, a total of 508 clinical specimens (stool, throat swab, and vesicle fluid) were collected from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Henan Province. Virological investigations (virus isolation, conventional reverse transcription PCR, and real-time reverse transcription PCR) and phylogenetic analysis were performed. It was found that human enterovirus 71 (EV71) was the main pathogen causing this outbreak, while Coxsackievirus A16 (CoxA16) played only a subsidiary role. Phylogenetic analysis of 24 EV71 isolates collected during the period from March 11 to July 24, 2009 showed that they belonged to subgenotypes C4 and C5. Our study for the first time characterizes the epidemiology of HFMD and EV71 infection in Henan Province in 2009 and provides the first direct evidence of the genotype of EV71 circulating in Henan Province at that time. Our study should facilitate the development of public health measures for the control and prevention of HFMD and EV71 infection in at-risk individuals in China.

In this interval, there were 398 annotated genes. Then, whole exome sequencing was applied in three patients and one normal individual from this family. Six single nucleotide variants and two indels were found co-segregated with the phenotypes. Then using mass spectrum (Sequenom, Inc.) to rank the eight sites, we found only the TNC gene be co-segregated with hearing loss in 53 subjects of F013. And this missense mutation (c.5317G>A, p.V1773M) of TNC located exactly in the critical linked interval. Further screening to the coding region of this gene in 587 subjects with nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL) found a second missense mutation, c.5368A>T (p. T1796S), co-segregating with phenotype in the other family. These two mutations located in the conserved region of TNC and were absent in the 387 normal hearing individuals of matched geographical ancestry. Functional effects of the two mutations were predicted using SIFT and both mutations were deleterious. All these results supported that TNC may be the causal gene for the hearing loss inherited in these families. TNC encodes tenascin-C, a member of the extracellular matrix (ECM), is present in the basilar membrane (BM), and the osseous spiral lamina of the cochlea. It plays an important role in cochlear development. The up-regulated expression of TNC gene in tissue repair and neural regeneration was seen in human and zebrafish, and in sensory receptor recovery in the vestibular organ after ototoxic injury in birds. Then the absence of normal tenascin-C was supposed to cause irreversible injuries in cochlea and caused hearing loss.

Methods: Forty-seven probands from unrelated families with CORD were recruited. Genomic DNA prepared from leukocytes was analyzed by whole exome sequencing. Variants in the 25 genes were selected and then validated by Sanger sequencing. Results: Fourteen potential pathogenic mutations, including nine novel and five known, were identified in 10 of the 47 families (21.28%). Homozygous, compound heterozygous, and hemizygous mutations were detected in three, four, or three families, respectively. The 14 mutations in the 10 families were distributed among CNGB3 (three families), PDE6C (two families), ABCA4 (one family), RPGRIP1 (one family), RPGR (two families), and CACNA1F (one family). Conclusions: This study provides a brief view on mutation spectrum of the 25 genes in a Chinese cohort with CORD. Identification of novel mutations enriched our understanding of variations in these genes and their associated phenotypes. To our knowledge, this is the first systemic exome-sequencing analysis of all of the 25 CORD-associated genes.

However, most previous research based on maternal plasma sequencing has been restricted to fetal aneuploidies. To detect specific parentally inherited mutations, invasive approaches to obtain fetal DNA are the current standard in the clinic because of the experimental complexity and resource consumption of previously reported non-invasive approaches. Methods: Here, we present a simple and effective non-invasive method for accurate fetal genome recovery-assisted with parental haplotypes. The parental haplotype were firstly inferred using a combination strategy of trio and unrelated individuals. Assisted with the parental haplotype, we then employed a hidden Markov model to non-invasively recover the fetal genome through maternal plasma sequencing. Results: Using a sequence depth of approximately 44X against a an approximate 5.69% cff-DNA concentration, we non-invasively inferred fetal genotype and haplotype under different situations of parental heterozygosity. Our data show that 98.57%, 95.37%, and 98.45% of paternal autosome alleles, maternal autosome alleles, and maternal chromosome X in the fetal haplotypes, respectively, were recovered accurately. Additionally, we obtained efficient coverage or strong linkage of 96.65% of reported Mendelian-disorder genes and 98.90% of complex disease-associated markers. Conclusions: Our method provides a useful strategy for non-invasive whole fetal genome recovery.

The Illumina sequencing platforms, with their much higher throughputs, could potentially reduce sequencing costs and improve sequence quality, but the associated shorter read length (typically <150bp) has deterred their usage in next-generation-sequencing (NGS)-based analyses of eukaryotic biodiversity, which often utilize standard barcode markers (e.g. COI, rbcL, matK, ITS) that are hundreds of nucleotides long. We present a new Illumina-based pipeline to recover full-length COI barcodes from mixed arthropod samples. Our new assembly program, SOAPBarcode, a variant of the genome assembly program SOAPdenovo, uses paired-end reads of the standard COI barcode region as anchors to extract the correct pathways (sequences) out of otherwise chaotic de Bruijn graphs', which are caused by the presence of large numbers of COI homologs of high sequence similarity. Two bulk insect samples of known species composition have been analysed in a recently published 454 metabarcoding study (Yu etal. 2012) and are re-analysed by our analysis pipeline. Compared to the results of Roche 454 (c.400-bp reads), our pipeline recovered full-length COI barcodes (658bp) and 17-31% more species-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from bulk insect samples, with fewer untraceable (novel) OTUs. On the other hand, our PCR-based pipeline also revealed higher rates of contamination across samples, due to the Illumina's increased sequencing depth. On balance, the assembled full-length barcodes and increased OTU recovery rates resulted in more resolved taxonomic assignments and more accurate beta diversity estimation. The HiSeq 2000 and the SOAPBarcode pipeline together can achieve more accurate biodiversity assessment at a much reduced sequencing cost in metabarcoding analyses. However, greater precaution is needed to prevent cross-sample contamination during field preparation and laboratory operation because of greater ability to detect non-target DNA amplicons present in low-copy numbers.

This basal eudicot species is especially important from an evolutionary perspective, as it occupies a critical phylogenetic position in flowering plants. Here we report the draft genome of a wild strain of sacred lotus. The assembled genome is 792Mb, which is approximately 85-90% of genome size estimates. We annotated 392 Mb of repeat sequences and 36385 protein-coding genes within the genome. Using these sequence data, we constructed a phylogenetic tree and confirmed the basal location of sacred lotus within eudicots. Importantly, we found evidence for a relatively recent whole-genome duplication event; any indication of the ancient paleo-hexaploid event was, however, absent. Genomic analysis revealed evidence of positive selection within 28 embryo-defective genes and one annexin gene that may be related to the long-term viability of sacred lotus seed. We also identified a significant expansion of starch synthase genes, which probably elevated starch levels within the rhizome of sacred lotus. Sequencing this strain of sacred lotus thus provided important insights into the evolution of flowering plant and revealed genetic mechanisms that influence seed dormancy and starch synthesis.

Whole genome amplification (WGA) and massively parallel sequencing have been applied to single cell CNVs analysis, which provides new insight for the fields of biology and medicine. However, the WGA-induced bias significantly limits sensitivity and specificity for CNVs detection. Addressing these limitations, we developed a practical bioinformatic methodology for CNVs detection at the single cell level using low coverage massively parallel sequencing. This method consists of GC correction for WGA-induced bias removal, binary segmentation algorithm for locating CNVs breakpoints, and dynamic threshold determination for final signals filtering. Afterwards, we evaluated our method with seven test samples using low coverage sequencing (4 similar to 9.5%). Four single-cell samples from peripheral blood, whose karyotypes were confirmed by whole genome sequencing analysis, were acquired. Three other test samples derived from blastocysts whose karyotypes were confirmed by SNP-array analysis were also recruited. The detection results for CNVs of larger than 1 Mb were highly consistent with confirmed results reaching 99.63% sensitivity and 97.71% specificity at base-pair level. Our study demonstrates the potential to overcome WGA-bias and to detect CNVs (>1 Mb) at the single cell level through low coverage massively parallel sequencing. It highlights the potential for CNVs research on single cells or limited DNA samples and may prove as a promising tool for research and clinical applications, such as pre-implantation genetic diagnosis/screening, fetal nucleated red blood cells research and cancer heterogeneity analysis.

Although more than 20 disease-causing genes have been identified, many patients are still currently without a molecular diagnosis. In a two-generation autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia family, we mapped a linkage to a minimal candidate region on chromosome 16p13.3 flanked by single-nucleotide polymorphism markers rs11248850 and rs1218762. By combining the defined linkage region with the whole-exome sequencing results, we identified a homozygous mutation (c. 493CT) in CHIP (NM_005861) in this family. Using Sanger sequencing, we also identified two compound heterozygous mutations (c. 389AT/c. 441GT; c. 621C>G/c. 707GC) in CHIP gene in two additional kindreds. These mutations co-segregated exactly with the disease in these families and were not observed in 500 control subjects with matched ancestry. CHIP colocalized with NR2A, a subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, in the cerebellum, pons, medulla oblongata, hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Wild-type, but not disease-associated mutant CHIPs promoted the degradation of NR2A, which may underlie the pathogenesis of ataxia. In conclusion, using a combination of whole-exome sequencing and linkage analysis, we identified CHIP, encoding a U-box containing ubiquitin E3 ligase, as a novel causative gene for autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia.

Recently, targeted resequencing by pooling long-range polymerase chain reaction (LR-PCR) amplicons has been used in the identification of mutations in ADPKD. Despite its high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy, LR-PCR is still complicated. We performed whole-exome sequencing on two unrelated typical Chinese ADPKD probands and evaluated the effectiveness of this approach compared with Sanger sequencing. Meanwhile, we performed targeted gene and next-generation sequencing (targeted DNA-HiSeq) on 8 individuals (1 patient from one family, 5 patients and 2 normal individuals from another family). Both whole-exome sequencing and targeted DNA-HiSeq confirmed c.11364delC (p.H3788QfsX37) within the unduplicated region of PKD1 in one proband; in the other family, targeted DNA-HiSeq identified a small insertion, c.401_402insG (p.V134VfsX79), in PKD2. These methods do not overcome the screening complexity of homology. However, the true positives of variants confirmed by targeted gene and next-generation sequencing were 69.4%, 50% and 100% without a false positive in the whole coding region and the duplicated and unduplicated regions, which indicated that the screening accuracy of PKD1 and PKD2 can be largely improved by using a greater sequencing depth and elaborate design of the capture probe.

Recent studies indicate possible links between insect gut microbiota and resistance to biological and chemical toxins. Studies of this phenomenon and symbionts in general have been hampered by difficulties in culture-based approach. In the present study, DNA sequencing was used to examine the midgut microbiota of diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella (L.), a destructive pest that attacks cruciferous crops worldwide. Its ability to develop resistance to many types of synthetic insecticide and even Bacillus thuringiensis toxins makes it an important species to study. Methodology/Principal Findings: Bacteria of the DBM larval midgut in a susceptible and two insecticide (chlorpyrifos and fipronil) resistant lines were examined by Illumina sequencing sampled from an insect generation that was not exposed to insecticide. This revealed that more than 97% of the bacteria were from three orders: Enterobacteriales, Vibrionales and Lactobacillales. Both insecticide-resistant lines had more Lactobacillales and the much scarcer taxa Pseudomonadales and Xanthomonadales with fewer Enterobacteriales compared with the susceptible strain. Consistent with this, a second study observed an increase in the proportion of Lactobacillales in the midgut of DBM individuals from a generation treated with insecticides. Conclusions/Significance: This is the first report of high-throughput DNA sequencing of the entire microbiota of DBM. It reveals differences related to inter-and intra-generational exposure to insecticides. Differences in the midgut microbiota among susceptible and insecticide-resistant lines are independent of insecticide exposure in the sampled generations. While this is consistent with the hypothesis that Lactobacillales or other scarcer taxa play a role in conferring DBM insecticide resistance, further studies are necessary to rule out other possibilities. Findings constitute the basis for future molecular work on the functions of insect midgut microbiota taxa and their possible role in conferring host resistance to toxins.

Commercial production of orange-spotted grouper could be increased by developing higher growth rates and improving commercially important traits. Information on genetic markers associated with quantitative trait loci (QTL) can be used in breeding programs to identify and select individuals carrying desired traits. A high-density genetic linkage map is the basis for QTL study, and multiplexed shotgun genotyping (MSG) facilitates the development of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genotyping. In this study, the first high-density genetic linkage maps for groupers were generated on the basis of the MSG method. Results: The sex-averaged map contained a total of 4,608 SNPs, which spanned 1581.7 cM, with a mean distance between SNPs of 0.34 cM. The 4,608 SNPs were located in 2,849 unique locations on the linkage map, with an average inter-location space at 0.56 cM. There were 2,516 SNPs on the female map, and the number of unique locus was 1,902. However, the male map contained more numbers of SNP (2,939) and unique locations (2,005). The total length of the female and male maps was 1,370.9 and 1,335.5 cM, respectively.

Sanger sequencing-based typing is the gold standard for genotyping, but it has been underused, due to its high cost and low throughput. In contrast, short-read sequencing provides inexpensive and high-throughput sequencing, holding great promise for reaching the goal of cost-effective and high-throughput genotyping. However, the short-read length and the paucity of appropriate genotyping methods, pose a major challenge. Here, we present RCHSBTreliable, cost-effective and high-throughput sequence based typing pipelinewhich takes short sequence reads as input, but uses a unique variant calling, haploid sequence assembling algorithm, can accurately genotype with greater effective length per amplicon than even Sanger sequencing reads. The RCHSBT method was tested for the human MHC loci HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DQB1, and HLA-DRB1, upon 96 samples using Illumina PE 150 reads. Amplicons as long as 950bp were readily genotyped, achieving 100% typing concordance between RCHSBT-called genotypes and genotypes previously called by Sanger sequence. Genotyping throughput was increased over 10 times, and cost was reduced over five times, for RCHSBT as compared with Sanger sequence genotyping. We thus demonstrate RCHSBT to be a genotyping method comparable to Sanger sequencing-based typing in quality, while being more cost-effective, and higher throughput. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

To better understand the regulatory mechanism of immature embryo dedifferentiation, we generated four small RNA and degradome libraries from samples representing the major stages of dedifferentiation. More than 186 million raw reads of small RNA and degradome sequence data were generated. We detected 102 known miRNAs belonging to 23 miRNA families. In total, we identified 51, 70 and 63 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) in the stage I, II, III samples, respectively, compared to the control. However, only 6 miRNAs were continually up-regulated by more than fivefold throughout the process of dedifferentiation. A total of 87 genes were identified as the targets of 21 DEM families. This group of targets was enriched in members of four significant pathways including plant hormone signal transduction, antigen processing and presentation, ECM-receptor interaction, and alpha-linolenic acid metabolism. The hormone signal transduction pathway appeared to be particularly significant, involving 21 of the targets. While the targets of the most significant DEMs have been proved to play essential roles in cell dedifferentiation. Our results provide important information regarding the regulatory networks that control immature embryo dedifferentiation in maize. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis (T. tengcongensis), a typical anaerobic thermophilic eubacterium, was selected to quantitatively evaluate its protein abundance changes in response to four different temperatures. With optimized procedures of isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation quantitative proteomics (iTRAQ), such as peptide fractionation with high-pH reverse phase (RP) high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), tandem MS acquisition mode in LTQ Orbitrap Velos MS, and evaluation of the quantification algorithms, high quality of the quantitative information of the peptides identified were acquired. In total, 1589 unique proteins were identified and defined 251 as the temperature-dependent proteins. Analysis of genomic locations toward the correspondent genes of these temperature-dependent proteins revealed that more than 30% were contiguous units with relevant biological functions, which are likely to form the operon structures in T. tengcongensis. The RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data further demonstrated that these cluster genes were cotranscribed, and their mRNA abundance changes responding to temperature exhibited the similar trends as the proteomic results, suggesting that the temperature-dependent proteins are highly associated with the correspondent transcription status. Hence, the operon regulation is likely an energy-efficient mode for T. tengcongensis survival. In addition, evaluation to the functions of differential proteomes indicated that the abundance of the proteins participating in sulfur-respiration on the plasma membrane was decreased as the temperature increased, whereas the glycolysis-related protein abundance was increased. The energy supply in T. tengcongensis at high temperature is, therefore, speculated not mainly through the respiration chain reactions.

Genome-wide profiling of 5-hmC thus far indicates 5-hmC may not only be an intermediate form of DNA demethylation but could also constitute an epigenetic mark per se. Here we describe a cost-effective and selective method to detect both the hydroxymethylation and methylation status of cytosines in a subset of cytosines in the human genome. This method involves the selective glucosylation of 5-hmC residues, short-Sequence tag generation and high-throughput sequencing. We tested this method by screening H9 human embryonic stem cells and their differentiated embroid body cells, and found that differential hydroxymethylation preferentially occurs in bivalent genes during cellular differentiation. Especially, our results support hydroxymethylation can regulate key transcription regulators with bivalent marks through demethylation and affect cellular decision on choosing active or inactive state of these genes upon cellular differentiation. Future application of this technology would enable us to uncover the status of methylation and hydroxymethylation in dynamic biological processes and disease development in multiple biological samples.

This study focused on morphological diagnoses for larvae occurring in the Churchill, Manitoba area, representing the largest larval association effort for the caddisflies at any given locality thus far. The current DNA barcode reference library of Trichoptera (available on the Barcode of Life Data Systems) was utilized to provide larval-adult associations. Results: The present study collected an additional 23 new species records for the Churchill area, increasing the total Trichoptera richness to 91 species. We were able to associate 62 larval taxa, comprising 68.1% of the Churchill area Trichoptera taxa. This endeavor to identify immature life stage for the caddisflies enabled the development of morphological diagnoses, production of photographs and an appropriate taxonomic key to facilitate larval species analyses in the area. Conclusions: The use of DNA for associations of unknown larvae with known adults proved rapid and successful. This method should accelerate the state-of-knowledge for North American Trichoptera larvae as well as other taxonomic lineages. The morphological analysis should be useful for determination of material from the Churchill area.

In this method, the fragments with HBV sequence were enriched by a set of HBV probes and then processed to high-throughput sequencing. In order to evaluate the performance of HIVID, we compared the results of HIVID with that of whole genome sequencing method (WGS) in 28 HCC tumors. We detected a total of 246 HBV integration breakpoints in HCC genome, 113 out of which were within 400 bp upstream or downstream of 125 breakpoints identified by WGS method, covering 89.3% (125/140) of total breakpoints. The integration was located in the gene TERT, MLL4, and CCNE1. In addition, we discovered 133 novel breakpoints missed by WGS method, with 66.7% (10/15) of validation rate. Our study shows HIVID is a cost-effective methodology with high specificity and sensitivity to identify viral integration in human genome. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc.

It has been estimated that several hundred genes may be associated with this sensory deficit in humans. Here, we identified compound heterozygous mutations in the TMC1 gene as the cause of recessively inherited sensorineural hearing loss by using whole-exome sequencing in a family with two deaf siblings. Sanger sequencing confirmed that both siblings inherited a missense mutation, c.589G>A p.G197R (maternal allele), and a nonsense mutation, c.1171C>T p.Q391X (paternal allele), in TMC1. We also used DNA from 50 Chinese familial patients with ARNSHL and 208 ethnicity-matched negative samples to perform extended variants analysis. Both variants co-segregated in family 1953, which had the hearing loss phenotype, but were absent in 50 patients and 208 ethnicity-matched controls. Therefore, we concluded that the hearing loss in this family was caused by novel compound heterozygous mutations in TMC1.

Integrative analyses of gene expression and DNA methylation profiles in breast cancer cell line models of tamoxifen-resistance indicate a potential role of cells with stem-like properties	BREAST CANCER RESEARCH			English	Article							HORMONE-INDEPENDENT GROWTH; ESTROGEN-RECEPTOR FUNCTION; ANTIESTROGEN RESISTANCE; IN-VITRO; STEM/PROGENITOR CELLS; ENDOCRINE RESISTANCE; REGULATED GENES; MCF-7 CELLS; FOXA1; TRANSCRIPTION	Introduction: Development of resistance to tamoxifen is an important clinical issue in the treatment of breast cancer. Tamoxifen resistance may be the result of acquisition of epigenetic regulation within breast cancer cells, such as DNA methylation, resulting in changed mRNA expression of genes pivotal for estrogen-dependent growth. Alternatively, tamoxifen resistance may be due to selection of pre-existing resistant cells, or a combination of the two mechanisms. Methods: To evaluate the contribution of these possible tamoxifen resistance mechanisms, we applied modified DNA methylation-specific digital karyotyping (MMSDK) and digital gene expression (DGE) in combination with massive parallel sequencing to analyze a well-established tamoxifen-resistant cell line model (TAM(R)), consisting of 4 resistant and one parental cell line. Another tamoxifen-resistant cell line model system (LCC1/LCC2) was used to validate the DNA methylation and gene expression results. Results: Significant differences were observed in global gene expression and DNA methylation profiles between the parental tamoxifen-sensitive cell line and the 4 tamoxifen-resistant TAM(R) sublines. The 4 TAM(R) cell lines exhibited higher methylation levels as well as an inverse relationship between gene expression and DNA methylation in the promoter regions. A panel of genes, including NRIP1, HECA and FIS1, exhibited lower gene expression in resistant vs. parental cells and concurrent increased promoter CGI methylation in resistant vs. parental cell lines. A major part of the methylation, gene expression, and pathway alterations observed in the TAM(R) model were also present in the LCC1/LCC2 cell line model. More importantly, high expression of SOX2 and alterations of other SOX and E2F gene family members, as well as RB-related pocket protein genes in TAM(R) highlighted stem cell-associated pathways as being central in the resistant cells and imply that cancer-initiating cells/cancer stem-like cells may be involved in tamoxifen resistance in this model. Conclusion: Our data highlight the likelihood that resistant cells emerge from cancer-initiating cells/cancer stem-like cells and imply that these cells may gain further advantage in growth via epigenetic mechanisms. Illuminating the expression and DNA methylation features of putative cancer-initiating cells/cancer stem cells may suggest novel strategies to overcome tamoxifen resistance.

The Chinese Human Chromosome Proteome Consortium has initiated proteomic exploration of protein-encoding genes on human chromosomes 1, 8, and 20. Collaboration within the the consortium has generated a comprehensive proteome data set using normal and carcinomatous tissues from human liver, stomach, and colon and 13 cell lines originating in these organs. We identified 12,101 proteins (59.8%) coverage against Swiss-Prot human entries) with a protein false discovery rate of less than 1%. On chromosome 1, 1,252 proteins mapping to 1,227 genes, representing 60.9% of Swiss-Prot entries, were identified; however, 805 proteins remain unidentified, suggesting that analysis of more diverse samples using more advanced proteomic technologies is required. Genes encoding the unidentified proteins were concentrated in seven blocks, located at p36, q12-21, and q42-44, partly consistent with correlation of these blocks with cancers of the liver, stomach, and colon. Combined transcriptome, proteome, and confuntionality analyses confirmed 23 coexpression clusters containing 165 genes. Biological information, including chromosome structure, GC content, and protein coexpression pattern was analyzed using multilayered, circular visualization and tabular visualization. Details of data analysis and updates are available in the Chinese Chromosome-Centric Human Proteome Database (http://proteomeview.hupo.org.cn/chromosome/).

Background: Mei (Prunus mume Sieb. et Zucc.) is a famous ornamental plant and fruit crop grown in East Asian countries. Limited genetic resources, especially molecular markers, have hindered the progress of mei breeding projects. Here, we performed low-depth whole-genome sequencing of Prunus mume 'Fenban' and Prunus mume 'Kouzi Yudie' to identify high-quality polymorphic markers between the two cultivars on a large scale. Results: A total of 1464.1 Mb and 1422.1 Mb of ` Fenban' and ` Kouzi Yudie' sequencing data were uniquely mapped to the mei reference genome with about 6-fold coverage, respectively. We detected a large number of putative polymorphic markers from the 196.9 Mb of sequencing data shared by the two cultivars, which together contained 200,627 SNPs, 4,900 InDels, and 7,063 SSRs. Among these markers, 38,773 SNPs, 174 InDels, and 418 SSRs were distributed in the 22.4 Mb CDS region, and 63.0% of these marker-containing CDS sequences were assigned to GO terms. Subsequently, 670 selected SNPs were validated using an Agilent's SureSelect solution phase hybridization assay. A subset of 599 SNPs was used to assess the genetic similarity of a panel of mei germplasm samples and a plum (P. salicina) cultivar, producing a set of informative diversity data. We also analyzed the frequency and distribution of detected InDels and SSRs in mei genome and validated their usefulness as DNA markers. These markers were successfully amplified in the cultivars and in their segregating progeny. Conclusions: A large set of high-quality polymorphic SNPs, InDels, and SSRs were identified in parallel between 'Fenban' and 'Kouzi Yudie' using low-depth whole-genome sequencing. The study presents extensive data on these polymorphic markers, which can be useful for constructing high-resolution genetic maps, performing genome-wide association studies, and designing genomic selection strategies in mei.

Cytoplasmic Male Sterility-Associated Chimeric Open Reading Frames Identified by Mitochondrial Genome Sequencing of Four Cajanus Genotypes	DNA RESEARCH			English	Article						mitochondria; pigeonpea; next-generation sequencing; cytoplasmic male sterility; open reading frames	COMPLETE NUCLEOTIDE-SEQUENCE; NUCLEAR MALE-STERILITY; PURITY ASSESSMENT; GENE-TRANSFER; SSR MARKERS; RICE; EVOLUTION; PLANTS; ORGANIZATION; HYBRID	The hybrid pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) breeding technology based on cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is currently unique among legumes and displays major potential for yield increase. CMS is defined as a condition in which a plant is unable to produce functional pollen grains. The novel chimeric open reading frames (ORFs) produced as a results of mitochondrial genome rearrangements are considered to be the main cause of CMS. To identify these CMS-related ORFs in pigeonpea, we sequenced the mitochondrial genomes of three C. cajan lines (the male-sterile line ICPA 2039, the maintainer line ICPB 2039, and the hybrid line ICPH 2433) and of the wild relative (Cajanus cajanifolius ICPW 29). A single, circular-mapping molecule of length 545.7 kb was assembled and annotated for the ICPA 2039 line. Sequence annotation predicted 51 genes, including 34 protein-coding and 17 RNA genes. Comparison of the mitochondrial genomes from different Cajanus genotypes identified 31 ORFs, which differ between lines within which CMS is present or absent. Among these chimeric ORFs, 13 were identified by comparison of the related male-sterile and maintainer lines. These ORFs display features that are known to trigger CMS in other plant species and to represent the most promising candidates for CMS-related mitochondrial rearrangements in pigeonpea.

Under domesticated conditions, many traits can be observed that cannot only be due to environmental alteration. In the case of silkworms, aside from genetic divergence, whether epigenetic divergence played a role in domestication is an unanswered question. The silkworm is still an enigma in that it has two DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1 and DNMT2) but their functionality is unknown. Even in particular the functionality of the widely distributed DNMT1 remains unknown in insects in general. Results: By embryonic RNA interference, we reveal that knockdown of silkworm Dnmt1 caused decreased hatchability, providing the first direct experimental evidence of functional significance of insect Dnmt1. In the light of this fact and those that DNA methylation is correlated with gene expression in silkworms and some agronomic traits in domesticated organisms are not stable, we comprehensively compare silk gland methylomes of 3 domesticated (Bombyx mori) and 4 wild (Bombyx mandarina) silkworms to identify differentially methylated genes between the two. We observed 2-fold more differentiated methylated cytosinces (mCs) in domesticated silkworms as compared to their wild counterparts, suggesting a trend of increasing DNA methylation during domestication. Further study of more domesticated and wild silkworms narrowed down the domesticates' epimutations, and we were able to identify a number of differential genes. One such gene showing demethyaltion in domesticates correspondently displays lower gene expression, and more interestingly, has experienced selective sweep. A methylation-increased gene seems to result in higher expression in domesticates and the function of its Drosophila homolog was previously found to be essential for cell volume regulation, indicating a possible correlation with the enlargement of silk glands in domesticated silkworms. Conclusions: Our results imply epigenetic influences at work during domestication, which gives insight into long time historical controversies regarding acquired inheritance.

Widespread epigenetic reprogramming of DNA and histone modifications tightly regulates gene expression and cellular activity during carcinogenesis, and epigenetic therapy has been developed to design efficient strategies for cancer treatment. As the first oral agent approved for the clinical treatment of cancer, sorafenib has significant inhibitory effects on tumor growth and EMT. However, a detailed understanding of the underlying epigenetic mechanism remains elusive. In this manuscript, we performed a ChIP-seq assay to evaluate the activity of sorafenib on the genome-wide profiling of histone modifications. We demonstrate that sorafenib largely reverses the changes in histone modifications that occur during EMT in A549 alveolar epithelial cells. Sorafenib also significantly reduces the coordinated epigenetic switching of critical EMT-associated genes in accordance with their expression levels. Furthermore, we show that sorafenib potentiates histone acetylation by regulating the expression levels of histone-modifying enzymes. Collectively, these findings provide the first evidence that sorafenib inhibits the EMT process through an epigenetic mechanism, which holds enormous promise for identifying novel epigenetic candidate diagnostic markers and drug targets for the treatment of human malignancies.

However, neonates with late-onset and progressive hearing impairment will be missed by NHS. Genetic factors account for an estimated 60% of congenital profound hearing loss. Our previous cohort studies were carried out in an innovative mode, i.e. hearing concurrent genetic screening, in newborns to improve the abilities or early diagnosis and intervention for the hearing defects. In this study, we performed the first clinical practice of this mode in Tianjin city. Methods: A large cohort of 58,397 neonates, born between December 2011 and December 2012, in 44 hospitals in Tianjin, were screened for 20 hot spot hearing loss associated mutations from GJB2, GJB3, SLC26A4 and MTRNR1(12S rRNA). The data of genetic screening results was comprehensively analyzed with newborn hearing screening (NHS) results. Results: We developed an accurate, high throughput genetic screening method and applied it to a total of 58,397 newborns in Tianjin. 3225 (5.52%) infants were detected to carry at least one mutation allele in GJB2, GJB3, SLC26A4 or MTRNR1. 34 (0.58 parts per thousand.) infants were positive for hearing loss caused by GJB2 or SLC26A4 mutations (homozygote or compound heterozygote). 54(0.93 parts per thousand) infants are heterozygous of various genes. 109(1.87 parts per thousand) infants had the pathological mitochondrial DNA mutation. Conclusion: Accurate, comprehensive hearing loss associated genetic screening can facilitate genetic counseling and provides valuable prognostic information to affected infants. This united screening mode of this study was a promising clinical practice. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

High-throughput gene expression analysis has been extensively used to explore mechanisms responsible for these disorders. Our study, for the first time, provides a comparative proteomic analysis between embryos after in vivo fertilization and development (IVO, control) and in vitro fertilization and culture (IVP). By comparing the dynamic proteome during the postimplantation period, we identified 300 and 262 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between IVO and IVP embryos at embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5) and E10.5, respectively. Bioinformatic analysis showed many DEPs functionally associated with post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational regulation, and these observations were consistent with correlation analysis between mRNA and protein abundance. In addition to altered gene expression due to IVP procedures, our findings suggest that aberrant processes at these various levels also contributed to proteomic alterations. In addition, numerous DEPs were involved in energy and amino acid metabolism, as well as neural and sensory development. These DEPs are potential candidates for further exploring the mechanism(s) of ART-induced intrauterine growth restriction and neurodevelopmental disorders. Moreover, significant enrichment of DEPs in pathways of neurodegenerative diseases implies the potentially increased susceptibility of ART offspring to these conditions as adults.

DFSP often reveals a specific chromosome translocation, t(17;22)(q22;q13), which results in the fusion of collagen 1 alpha 1 (COL1A1) gene and platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGFB) gene. The COL1A1-PDGFB fusion protein activates the PDGFB receptor and resultant constitutive activation of PDGFR receptor is essential in the pathogenesis of DFSP. Thus, blocking PDGFR receptor activation with imatinib has shown promising activity in the treatment of advanced and metastatic DFSP. Despite the success with targeted agents in cancers, acquired drug resistance eventually occurs. Here, we tried to identify potential drug resistance mechanisms against imatinib in a 46-year old female with DFSP who initially responded well to imatinib but suffered rapid disease progression. We performed whole-genome sequencing of both pre-treatment and post-treatment tumor tissue to identify the mutational events associated with imatinib resistance. No significant copy number alterations, insertion, and deletions were identified during imatinib treatment. Of note, we identified newly emerged 8 non-synonymous somatic mutations of the genes (ACAP2, CARD10, KIAA0556, PAAQR7, PPP1R39, SAFB2, STARD9, and ZFYVE9) in the imatinib-resistant tumor tissue. This study revealed diverse possible candidate mechanisms by which imatinib resistance to PDGFRB inhibition may arise in DFSP, and highlights the usefulness of whole-genome sequencing in identifying drug resistance mechanisms and in pursuing genome-directed, personalized anti-cancer therapy.

Dissecting these alleles for desirable agronomic traits can be accomplished by comparing the genomes of elite varieties with those from non-elite populations. Here we deep-sequence six elite rice varieties and use two large control panels to identify elite variety tag single-nucleotide polymorphism alleles (ETASs). Guided by this preliminary analysis, we comprehensively characterize one protein-altering ETAS in the 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase gene of the IRAT104 upland rice variety. This allele displays a drastic frequency difference between upland and irrigated rice, and a selective sweep is observed around this allele. Functional analysis indicates that in upland rice, this allele is associated with significantly higher abscisic acid levels and denser lateral roots, suggesting its association with upland rice suitability. This report provides a potential strategy to mine rare, agronomically important alleles.

Turnaround times for previously tested platforms are still unsatisfactory for clinical applications, however, because of the time spent on sequencing. The development of semiconductor sequencing technology has provided a way to shorten overall run times. We studied the feasibility of using semiconductor sequencing technology for the noninvasive detection of fetal aneuploidy. METHODS: Maternal plasma DNA from 13 pregnant women, corresponding to 4 euploid, 6 trisomy 21 (T21), 2 trisomy 18 (T18), and 1 trisomy 13 (T13) pregnancies, were sequenced on the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine sequencer platform with 318 chips. The data were analyzed with the T statistic method after correcting for GC bias, and the T value was calculated as an indicator of fetal aneuploidy. RESULTS: We obtained a mean of 3 524 401 high-quality reads per sample, with an efficiency rate of 77.9%. All of the T21, T13, and T18 fetuses could be clearly distinguished from euploid fetuses, and the time spent on library preparation and sequencing was 24 h. CONCLUSIONS: Semiconductor sequencing represents a suitable technology for the noninvasive prenatal detection of fetal aneuploidy. With this platform, sequencing times can be substantially reduced; however, a further larger-scale study is needed to determine the imprecision of noninvasive fetal aneuploidy detection with this system.

Herein, we propose a quantitative method to measure human AKR proteins in cells using mTRAQ-based multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). AKR peptides with multiple transitions were carefully selected upon tryptic digestion of the recombinant AKR proteins, while AKR proteins were identified by SDS-PAGE fractionation coupled with LC-MS/MS. Utilizing mTRAQ triplex labeling to Produce the derivative peptides, calibration curves were generated using the mixed lysate as background, and no significantly different quantification of AKRs was elicited from the two sets of calibration curves under the mixed and single lysate as background. We employed this approach to quantitatively determine the 6 AKR proteins, AKR1A1, AKR1B1, AKR1B10, AKR1C1/C2, AKR1C3, and AKR1C4, in 7 different cancer cell lines and for the first time to obtain the absolute quantities of all the AKR proteins in each cell. The cluster plot revealed that AKR1A and AKR1B were widely distributed in most cancer cells with relatively stable abundances, whereas AKR1Cs were unevenly detected among these cells with diverse dynamic abundances. The AKR quantitative distribution in different cancer cells, therefore, may assist further exploration toward how the AKR proteins are involved in tumorigenesis.

Continued increases in rice yield will be required to break through the barriers to grain output. In order to transition from hybrid rice to super-hybrid rice, breeding demands cannot be addressed through traditional heterosis. Therefore, it is necessary to incorporate high yield loci from other rice genetic groups and to scientifically utilize intersubspecific heterosis in breeding lines. In this study, 781 lines from a segregating F-2 population constructed by crossing the indica variety, "Giant Spike Rice" R1128 as trait donor with the japonica cultivar 'Nipponbare', were re-sequenced using high-throughout multiplexed shotgun genotyping (MSG) technology. In combination with high-density single nucleotide polymorphisms, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and genetic effect analysis were performed for five yield factors (spikelet number per panicle, primary branches per panicle, secondary branches per panicle, plant height, and panicle length) to explore the genetic mechanisms underlying the formation of the giant panicle of R1128. Also, they were preformed to locate new high-yielding rice genetic intervals, providing data for super-high-yielding rice breeding. Results: QTL mapping and genetic effect analysis for five yield factors in the population gave the following results: 49 QTLs for the five yield factors were distributed on 11 of 12 chromosomes. The super-hybrid line R1128 carries multiple major genes for good traits, including Sd1 for plant height, Hd1 and Ehd1 for heading date, Gn1a for spikelet number and IPA1 for ideal plant shape. These genes accounted for 44.3%, 21.9%, 6.2%, 12.9% and 10.6% of the phenotypic variation in the individual traits. Six novel QTLs, qph1-2, qph9-1, qpl12-1, qgn3-1, qgn11-1and qsbn11-1 are reported here for the first time. Conclusions: High-throughout sequencing technology makes it convenient to study rice genomics and makes the QTL/gene mapping direct, efficient, and more reliable. The genetic regions discovered in this study will be valuable for breeding in rice varieties because of the diverse genetic backgrounds of the rice.

Combining with the rapidly developed massively parallel sequencing technology, noninvasive prenatal detection of chromosome aneuploidy and single base variation has been successfully validated. However, few studies discussed the possibility of noninvasive pathogenic CNVs detection. Methodology/Principal Findings: A novel algorithm for noninvasive prenatal detection of fetal pathogenic CNVs was firstly tested in 5 pairs of parents with heterozygote a-thalassemia of Southeast Asian (SEA) deletion using target region capture sequencing for maternal plasma. Capture probes were designed for alpha-globin (HBA) and beta-globin (HBB) gene, as well as 4,525 SNPs selected from 22 automatic chromosomes. Mixed adaptors with 384 different barcodes were employed to construct maternal plasma DNA library for massively parallel sequencing. The signal of fetal CNVs was calculated using the relative copy ratio (RCR) of maternal plasma combined with the analysis of R-score and L-score by comparing with normal control. With mean of 101.93xmaternal plasma sequencing depth for the target region, the RCR value combined with further R-score and L-score analysis showed a possible homozygous deletion in the HBA gene region for one fetus, heterozygous deletion for two fetus and normal for the other two fetus, which was consistent with that of invasive prenatal diagnosis. Conclusions/Significance: Our study showed the feasibility to detect pathogenic CNVs using target region capture sequencing, which might greatly extend the scope of noninvasive prenatal diagnosis.

Mollusk shell matrix proteins are important functional components that are embedded in the shell, which play important roles in shell formation. The proteome of the oyster shell had been determined based on the oyster genome sequence by our group and gives the chance for further deep study in this area. The classical model of shell formation posits that the shell proteins are mantle-secreted. But, in this study, we further analyzed the shell proteome data in combination with organ transcriptome data and we found that the shell proteins may be produced by multiple organs though the mantle is still the most important organ for shell formation. To identify the transport pathways of these shell proteins not in classical model of shell formation, we conducted a shell damage experiment and we determined the shell-related gene set to identify the possible transport pathways from multiple organs to the shell formation front. We also found that there may exist a remodeling mechanism in the process of shell formation. Based on these results along with some published results, we proposed a new immature model, which will help us think about the mechanism of shell formation in a different way.

Its high environmental adaptability might be attributable to its genome dynamics, which can be estimated through comparative genomic analysis targeting microorganisms with close phylogenetic relationships but different phenotypes. To shed light on speciation, gene content evolution, and environmental adaptation in these unique actinobacteria, we sequenced draft genomes for 16 representative species of the genus and compared them with that of the type species N. dassonvillei subsp. dassonvillei DSM 43111(T). The core genome of 1,993 orthologous and paralogous gene clusters was identified, and the pan-genomic reservoir was found not only to accommodate more than 22,000 genes, but also to be open. The top ten paralogous genes in terms of copy number could be referred to three functional categories: transcription regulators, transporters, and synthases related to bioactive metabolites. Based on phylogenomic reconstruction, we inferred past evolutionary events, such as gene gains and losses, and identified a list of clade-specific genes implicated in environmental adaptation. These results provided insights into the genetic causes of environmental adaptability in this cosmopolitan actinobacterial group and the contributions made by its inherent features, including genome dynamics and the constituents of core and accessory proteins.

A periodic expression of c-kit is observed from primordial germ cells (PGCs) to spermatogenetic stem cells (SSCs), However, the expression profile of c-kit during the entire spermatogenesis process is still unclear. This study aims to reveal and compare c-kit expression profiles in the SSCs before and after the anticipated differentiation, as well as to examine its relationship with retinoic acid (RA) stimulation. Results: We have found that there are more than 4 transcripts of c-kit expressed in the cell lines and in the testes. The transcripts can be divided into short and long categories. The long transcripts include the full-length canonical c-kit transcript and the 3' end short transcript. Short transcripts include the 3.4 kb short transcript and several truncated transcripts (1.9-3.2 kb). In addition, the 3.4 kb transcript (starting from intron 9 and covering exons 10 similar to 21) is discovered to be specifically expressed in the spermatogonia. The extracellular domain of Kit is obtained in the spermatogonia stage, but the intracellular domain (50 kDa) is constantly expressed in both SSCs and spermatogonia. The c-kit expression profiles in the testis and the spermatogonial stem cell lines vary after RA stimulation. The wave-like changes of the quantitative expression pattern of c-kit (increase initially and decrease afterwards) during the induction process are similar to that of the in vivo male germ cell development process. Conclusions: There are dynamic transcription and translation changes of c-kit before and after SSCs' anticipated differentiation and most importantly, RA is a significant upstream regulatory factor for c-kit expression.

Here, we identified ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2B (Ube2b) as a critical target gene of AR. The expression of UBE2B was decreased in the testes of Sertoli cell AR knockout (S-AR(-/y)) mice analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunofluorescence. The upregulation of Ube2b gene by testosterone was further demonstrated by Western blot and qRT-PCR in TM4 cells, a mouse Sertoli cell line. Moreover, luciferase assay, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay validated that the ligand-bound AR activated Ube2b transcription via direct binding to the androgen-responsive element of the Ube2b promoter. In vitro analyses showed that testosterone increased UBE2B expression and activated H2A ubiquitylation, while downregulation of UBE2B blocked the testosterone-induced H2A ubiquitylation. The ubiquitylation of H2A was markedly decreased in the testes of S-AR(-/y) mice by immunohistochemistry. Digital gene expression analysis showed that 113 genes were significantly downregulated and 71 were upregulated by UBE2B in TM4 cells. These results suggest that Ube2b, as a direct AR transcriptional target in Sertoli cells, mediates the function of AR in spermatogenesis by promoting H2A ubiquitylation.

Sequencing the whole exome of the adenoma will help identifying molecular biomarkers that can predict the occurrence of adenocarcinoma more precisely and help understanding the molecular pathways underlying the initial stage of colorectal tumorigenesis. We performed the exome capture sequencing of the normal mucosa, adenoma and adenocarcinoma tissues from the same patient and sequenced the identified mutations in additional 73 adenomas and 288 adenocarcinomas. Somatic single nucleotide variations (SNVs) were identified in both the adenoma and adenocarcinoma by comparing with the normal control from the same patient. We identified 12 nonsynonymous somatic SNVs in the adenoma and 42 nonsynonymous somatic SNVs in the adenocarcinoma. Most of these mutations including OR6X1, SLC15A3, KRTHB4, RBFOX1, LAMA3, CDH20, BIRC6, NMBR, GLCCI1, EFR3A, and FTHL17 were newly reported in colorectal adenomas. Functional annotation of these mutated genes showed that multiple cellular pathways including Wnt, cell adhesion and ubiquitin mediated proteolysis pathways were altered genetically in the adenoma and that the genetic alterations in the same pathways persist in the adenocarcinoma. CDH20 and LAMA3 were mutated in the adenoma while NRXN3 and COL4A6 were mutated in the adenocarcinoma from the same patient, suggesting for the first time that genetic alterations in the cell adhesion pathway occur as early as in the adenoma. Thus, the comparison of genomic mutations between adenoma and adenocarcinoma provides us a new insight into the molecular events governing the early step of colorectal tumorigenesis.

We have globally profiled proteomes in these samples with combined technology of LC-MS/MS and acquired the corresponding mRNA information upon RNA-seq and RNAchip. In total, 323 unique proteins were identified, covering 60% of the coding genes (323/547) in Chr.20. With regards to qualitative information of proteomics, we overall evaluated the correlation of the identified Chr.20 proteins with target genes of transcription factors or of microRNA, conserved genes and cancer-related genes. As for quantitative information, the expression abundances of Chr.20 genes were found to be almost consistent in both tissues and cell lines of mRNA in all individual chromosome regions, whereas those of Chr.20 proteins in cells are different from tissues, especially in the region of 20q13.33. Furthermore, the abundances of Chr.20 proteins were hierarchically evaluated according to tissue- or cancer-related distribution. The analysis revealed several cancer-related proteins in Chr.20 are tissue- or cell-type dependent. With integration of all the acquired data, for the first time we established a solid database of the Chr.20 proteome.

To identify the genetic defect responsible for congenital nuclear cataract in a four-generation Chinese Han family, exome and direct Sanger sequencings were conducted and a missense variant c.139G>A (p.D47N) in the gap junction protein-alpha 3 gene (GJA3) was identified. The variant co-segregated with patients of the family and was not observed in unaffected family members or normal controls. The above findings indicated that the variant was a pathogenic mutation. The mutation p.D47N was found in the first extracellular loop (El) domain of GJA3 protein. Our data suggest that exome sequencing is a powerful tool to discover mutation(s) in cataract,. a disorder with high genetic heterogeneity. Our findings may also provide new insights into the cause and diagnosis of congenital nuclear cataract and have implications for genetic counseling.

This study utilized a combination of HPV self-sampling, iFTA elute specimen cards, and long distance transport for centralized processing of specimens to determine the feasibility of large-scale screening in remote and transient populations. Methods. This study was performed in two locations in Peru (Manchay and Iquitos). The "Just For Me" cervico-vaginal brush and iFTA elute cards were used for the collection and transport of specimens. Samples were shipped via FedEx to China and tested for 14 types of high-risk HPV using PCR based MALDI-TOF. HPV positive women were treated with cryotherapy after VIA triage, and followed-up with colposcopy, biopsy, ECC, and repeat HPV testing at 6 months. Results. Six hundred and forty three women registered, and 632 returned a sample over a 10 day period. Within 2 weeks, specimens were shipped, samples tested, and results received by study staff. Sixty-eight women (10.8%) tested positive, and these results were delivered over 4 days. Fifty-nine HPV positive women (87%) returned for evaluation and treatment, and 2 had large lesions not suitable for cryotherapy. At 6 months, 42 women (74%) returned for follow-up, and 3 had CIN 2 (all positive samples from the endocervical canal). Ninety eight percent of participants reported that they would participate in this type of program again. Conclusions. Utilizing HPV self-sampling, solid media specimen cards for long distance transport, and centralized high throughput processing, we achieved rapid delivery of results, high satisfaction levels, and low loss to follow-up for cervical cancer screening in remote and transient populations.

The Chromosome-Centric Human Proteome Project of China systematically profiles the proteomes of three digestive organs (i.e., stomach, colon, and liver) and their corresponding carcinoma tissues/cell lines according to a chromosome organizational roadmap. By rigorous standards, we have identified 271 (38.7%), 330 (47.1%), and 325 (4-6.4%) of 701 chromosome 8-coded proteins from stomach, colon, and liver samples, respectively, in Swiss-Prot and observed a total coverage rate of up to 58.9% by 413 identified proteins. Using large-scale label-free proteome quantitation, we also found some 8p deficiencies, such as the presence of 8p21-p23 in tumorigenesis of the above-described digestive organs, which is in good agreement with previous reports. To our best knowledge, this is the first study to have verified these 8p deficiencies at the proteome level, complementing genome and transcriptome data.

Hereditary nonsyndromic hearing loss is highly heterogeneous, and most patients with a presumed genetic etiology lack a specific molecular diagnosis. Methods: By whole exome sequencing, we identified responsible gene of family 4794 with autosomal recessively nonsyndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL). We also used DNA from 56 Chinese familial patients with ARNSHL (autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss) and 108 ethnicity-matched negative samples to perform extended variants analysis. Results: We identified MYO15A c.IVS25 + 3G > A and c.8375 T > C (p.V2792A) as the disease-causing mutations. Both mutations co-segregated with hearing loss in family 4794, but were absent in the 56 index patients and 108 ethnicity-matched controls. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that the hearing loss of family 4794 was caused by novel compound heterozygous mutations in MYO15A.

Vitamin D levels below normal are associated with hospital stay, increased incidence of adverse prognosis and increased mortality of a number of diseases. Whether there is a relationship between vitamin D levels and infection or sepsis in the critically ill is still unclear. This study will explore the relationship between vitamin D levels and risk of infection, assessment for disease severity, and predictor of mortality. Methods To evaluate the value of vitamin D in intensive care unit (ICU) cases to sepsis, severity and prognosis assessment, high performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry were used to measure the concentrations of vitamin D in sera of critically ill patients. The serum samples were drawn within the first 24 hours of ICU admission. Results The study included 206 people, 50 healthy controls, 51 ICU control patients and 105 ICU diagnosed with sepsis. Critically ill ICU patients (ICU sepsis and ICU control group) had lower vitamin D concentration than normal people, but septic patients showed no significant reduction of vitamin D concentration when compared with critically ill patients with no positive etiological evidence. For assessment of disease severity, there were very low negative correlations between APACHE II, SAPS II and SOFA scores and vitamin D level. Additionally, patients of different 25-(OH)D levels showed no difference whether in terms of 28-day survival (chi(2)=1.78, P=0.776) or 90-day survival (chi(2)=4.12, P=0.389). Multivariate Logistic regression demonstrated that APECHE II and SAPS II scores were independent risk factors to deaths caused by sepsis. Conclusion Clinically, serum concentration of vitamin D is not an indicator for diagnosis and assessment in critically ill. patients (ClinicalTrial.gov identifier NCT01636232).

Multivariate data analysis was used to identify the discriminating signals. Interestingly, 12 metabolites contributing to the complete separation of HF from matched CAD were identified. Metabolic pathways including free fatty acids, sphingolipids and amino acid derivatives were found to be disturbed in HF patients compared with CAD patients. Lipid molecules associated with energy metabolism and signaling pathways may play key roles in the development of failing heart.

Most of the existing computational fusion detection tools are challenged by the issues of accuracy and how to handle multiple mappings. Results: We present a novel tool SOAPfusion for fusion discovery with paired-end RNA-Seq reads. SOAPfusion is accurate and efficient for fusion discovery with high sensitivity (epsilon 93%), low false-positive rate (1.36%), even the coverage is as low as 10x, highlighting its ability to detect fusions efficiently at low sequencing cost. From real data of Universal Human Reference RNA (UHRR) samples, SOAPfusion detected 7 novel fusion genes, more than other existing tools and all genes have been validated through reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction followed by Sanger sequencing. SOAPfusion thus proves to be an effective method with precise applicability in search of fusion transcripts, which is advantageous to accelerate pathological and therapeutic cancer studies.

Modeling MPN in a human context might be helpful for the screening of molecules targeting JAK2 and its intracellular signaling. We describe here the derivation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell lines from 2 polycythemia vera patients carrying a heterozygous and a homozygous mutated JAK2(V617F), respectively. In the patient with homozygous JAK2(V617F), additional ASXL1 mutation and chromosome 20 allowed partial delineation of the clonal architecture and assignation of the cellular origin of the derived iPS cell lines. The marked difference in the response to erythropoietin (EPO) between homozygous and heterozygous cell lines correlated with the constitutive activation level of signaling pathways. Strikingly, heterozygous iPS cells showed thrombopoietin (TPO)-independent formation of megakaryocytic colonies, but not EPO-independent erythroid colony formation. JAK2, PI3K and HSP90 inhibitors were able to block spontaneous and EPO-induced growth of erythroid colonies from GPA(+)CD41(+) cells derived from iPS cells. Altogether, this study brings the proof of concept that iPS can be used for studying MPN pathogenesis, clonal architecture, and drug efficacy.

To investigate the mitochondrial mechanisms underlying adaptation to extreme oxygen conditions, we generated Drosophila strains that could survive in low-or high-oxygen environments (LOF or HOF, respectively), examined their mitochondria at the ultrastructural level via transmission electron microscopy, studied the activity of their respiratory chain complexes, and quantitatively analyzed the protein abundance responses of the mitochondrial proteomes using Isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ). A total of 718 proteins were identified with high confidence, and 55 and 75 mitochondrial proteins displayed significant differences in abundance in LOF and HOF, respectively, compared with the control flies. Importantly, these differentially expressed mitochondrial proteins are primarily involved in respiration, calcium regulation, the oxidative response, and mitochondrial protein translation. A correlation analysis of the changes in the levels of the mRNAs corresponding to differentially regulated mitochondrial proteins revealed two sets of proteins with different modes of regulation (transcriptional vs. post-transcriptional) in both LOF and HOF. We believe that these findings will not only enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying adaptation to extreme oxygen conditions in Drosophila but also provide a clue in studying human disease induced by altered oxygen tension in tissues and cells.

Whole-Genome Sequences of DA and F344 Rats with Different Susceptibilities to Arthritis, Autoimmunity, Inflammation and Cancer	GENETICS			English	Article							QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI; COPY NUMBER VARIATION; STRUCTURAL VARIATION; GENE-EXPRESSION; INBRED STRAINS; SEVERITY; NUCLEOTIDE; PHENOTYPES; ALIGNMENT; IMPACT	DA (D-blood group of Palm and Agouti, also known as Dark Agouti) and F344 (Fischer) are two inbred rat strains with differences in several phenotypes, including susceptibility to autoimmune disease models and inflammatory responses. While these strains have been extensively studied, little information is available about the DA and F344 genomes, as only the Brown Norway (BN) and spontaneously hypertensive rat strains have been sequenced to date. Here we report the sequencing of the DA and F344 genomes using next-generation Illumina paired-end read technology and the first de novo assembly of a rat genome. DA and F344 were sequenced with an average depth of 32-fold, covered 98.9% of the BN reference genome, and included 97.97% of known rat ESTs. New sequences could be assigned to 59 million positions with previously unknown data in the BN reference genome. Differences between DA, F344, and BN included 19 million positions in novel scaffolds, 4.09 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (including 1.37 million new SNPs), 458,224 short insertions and deletions, and 58,174 structural variants. Genetic differences between DA, F344, and BN, including high-impact SNPs and short insertions and deletions affecting >2500 genes, are likely to account for most of the phenotypic variation between these strains. The new DA and F344 genome sequencing data should facilitate gene discovery efforts in rat models of human disease.

In the past, standard methods for genetic diagnosis of osteopetrosis have primarily been performed by candidate gene screening and positional cloning. However, these methods are time and labor consumptive; and the genetic basis of approximately 30% of the cases is yet to be elucidated. Here, we employed whole exome sequencing of two affected individuals from an osteopetrosis family to identify a candidate mutation in CLCN7 (Y99C). It was identified from a total of 1757 and 1728 genetic variations found in either patient, which were then distilled using filtering strategies and confirmed using Sanger sequencing. We identified this mutation in six family members, while not in population matched controls. This mutation was previously found in osteopetrosis patients by other researchers. Our evolutionary analysis also indicated that it is under extremely high selective pressure, and is likely to be critical for the correct function of ClC-7, and thus is likely to be the responsible cause of disease. Collectively, our data further indicated that mutation (Y99C) may be a cause of osteopetrosis, and highlights the use of whole exome sequencing as a valuable approach to identifying disease mutations in a cost and time efficient manner.

Quantifying the carbon uptake by vegetation for Europe on a 1 km(2) resolution using a remote sensing driven vegetation model	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							NET ECOSYSTEM EXCHANGE; TERRESTRIAL BIOSPHERE; PHOTOSYNTHETIC CAPACITY; GLOBAL-SCALE; LATENT-HEAT; EDDY FLUX; LEAF AGE; RESPIRATION; FOREST; UNCERTAINTIES	In this study we compare monthly gross primary productivity (GPP) time series (2000-2007), computed for Europe with the Biosphere Energy Transfer Hydrology (BETHY/DLR) model with monthly data from the eddy covariance measurements network FLUXNET. BETHY/DLR with a spatial resolution of 1 km(2) is designed for regional and continental applications (here Europe) and operated at the German Aerospace Center (DLR). It was adapted from the BETHY scheme to be driven by remote sensing data (leaf area index (LAI) and land cover information) and meteorology. Time series of LAI obtained from the CYCLOPES database are used to control the phenology of vegetation. Meteorological time series from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) are used as driver. These comprise daily information on temperature, precipitation, wind speed and radiation. Additionally, static maps such as land cover, elevation, and soil type are used. To validate our model results we used eddy covariance measurements from the FLUXNET network of 74 towers across Europe. For forest sites we found that our model predicts between 20 and 40% higher annual GPP sums. In contrast, for cropland sites BETHY/DLR results show about 18% less GPP than eddy covariance measurements. For grassland sites, between 10% more and 16% less GPP was calculated with BETHY/DLR. A mean total carbon uptake of 2.5 PgC a(-1) (+/- 0.17 PgC a(-1)) was found for Europe. In addition, this study reports on risks that arise from the comparison of modelled data to FLUXNET measurements and their interpretation width. Furthermore we investigate reasons for uncertainties in model results and focus here on V-max values, and finally embed our results into a broader context of model validation studies published during the last years in order to evaluate differences or similarities in analysed error sources.

Phylogeny and evolutionary history of glycogen synthase kinase 3/SHAGGY-like kinase genes in land plants	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						GSK3; Land plant evolution; Gene duplication; Gene expression	TREE SELECTION; SEED PLANTS; GENOME; FAMILY; EXPRESSION; DIVERSIFICATION; ORGANIZATION; DUPLICATION	Background: GSK3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3) genes encode signal transduction proteins with roles in a variety of biological processes in eukaryotes. In contrast to the low copy numbers observed in animals, GSK3 genes have expanded into a multi-gene family in land plants (embryophytes), and have also evolved functions in diverse plant specific processes, including floral development in angiosperms. However, despite previous efforts, the phylogeny of land plant GSK3 genes is currently unclear. Here, we analyze genes from a representative sample of phylogenetically pivotal taxa, including basal angiosperms, gymnosperms, and monilophytes, to reconstruct the evolutionary history and functional diversification of the GSK3 gene family in land plants. Results: Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic analyses resolve a gene tree with four major gene duplication events that coincide with the emergence of novel land plant clades. The single GSK3 gene inherited from the ancestor of land plants was first duplicated along the ancestral branch to extant vascular plants, and three subsequent duplications produced three GSK3 loci in the ancestor of euphyllophytes, four in the ancestor of seed plants, and at least five in the ancestor of angiosperms. A single gene in the Amborella trichopoda genome may be the sole survivor of a sixth GSK3 locus that originated in the ancestor of extant angiosperms. Homologs of two Arabidopsis GSK3 genes with genetically confirmed roles in floral development, AtSK11 and AtSK12, exhibit floral preferential expression in several basal angiosperms, suggesting evolutionary conservation of their floral functions. Members of other gene lineages appear to have independently evolved roles in plant reproductive tissues in individual taxa. Conclusions: Our phylogenetic analyses provide the most detailed reconstruction of GSK3 gene evolution in land plants to date and offer new insights into the origins, relationships, and functions of family members. Notably, the diversity of this "green" branch of the gene family has increased in concert with the increasing morphological and physiological complexity of land plant life forms. Expression data for seed plants indicate that the functions of GSK3 genes have also diversified during evolutionary time.

Relying on the unique feature of methylation-dependent digestion, the family of methylation-requiring restriction-like endonuclease, such as MspJI and its homologs, was suggested for a potential usage in methylation detection. Results: In this study, we combine MspJI digestion and electrophoretic band selection with next generation high-throughput sequencing technology to detect 5-methylcytosines in Arabidopsis genome. By developing a bioinformatics workflow to attribute the CNNR sites recognized by MspJI to the reference genome, we fulfilled the systematic assessment of this method. Conclusions: According to the assessment, here we provide the method for generating a detailed map of plant methylome that could be feasible, reliable and economical in methylation investigation.

Our objective was to further investigate the hypothesis that TIMP1 is associated with endocrine sensitivity. We established a panel of 11 MCF-7 subclones with a wide range of TIMP1 mRNA and protein expression levels. Cells with high expression of TIMP1 versus low TIMP1 displayed significantly reduced sensitivity to the antiestrogen fulvestrant (ICI 182,780, FaslodexA (R)), while TIMP1 levels did not influence the sensitivity to 4-hydroxytamoxifen. An inverse correlation between expression of the progesterone receptor and TIMP1 was found, but TIMP1 levels did not correlate with estrogen receptor levels or growth-promoting effects of estrogen (estradiol, E2). Additionally, the effects of fulvestrant, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, or estrogen on estrogen receptor expression were not associated with TIMP1 levels. Gene expression analyses revealed associations between expression of TIMP1 and genes involved in metabolic pathways, epidermal growth factor receptor 1/cancer signaling pathways, and cell cycle. Gene and protein expression analyses showed no general defects in estrogen receptor signaling except from lack of progesterone receptor expression and estrogen inducibility in clones with high TIMP1. The present study suggests a relation between high expression level of TIMP1 and loss of progesterone receptor expression combined with fulvestrant resistance. Our findings in vitro may have clinical implications as the data suggest that high tumor levels of TIMP1 may be a predictive biomarker for reduced response to fulvestrant.

NLRP7 or KHDC3L genes and the etiology of molar pregnancies and recurrent miscarriage	MOLECULAR HUMAN REPRODUCTION			English	Article						familial androgenetic hydatidiform mole; hydatidiform mole; KHDC3L; NLRP7; recurrent miscarriages	COMPLETE HYDATIDIFORM MOLE; GESTATIONAL TROPHOBLASTIC DISEASE; SUBSEQUENT PREGNANCY; REPRODUCTIVE WASTAGE; BIPARENTAL MOLES; MUTATIONS; PHENOTYPE; C6ORF221; ORIGIN; WOMEN	Women with mutation in both alleles of the NLRP7 or C6orf221/KHDC3L genes are predisposed to diploid biparental moles, but it has also been suggested that mutation in these genes can predispose to diploid androgenetic or triploid moles and to other kinds of reproductive wastage. We have investigated the association between molar pregnancy and recurrent miscarriages regarding changes in the NLRP7 and C6orf221/KHDC3L genes. Our study group can be divided into three sub-cohorts: (i) women having had at least one molar pregnancy and at least two non-mole miscarriages, (ii) women having had recurrent androgenetic hydatidiform moles and (iii) women having had one diploid androgenetic hydatidiform mole and a relative having had a hydatidiform mole (familial hydatidiform moles). We observed a statistically non-significant tendency of non-synonymous variants in NLRP7 to be more frequent in women with familial hydatidiform mole and in women with female family members with hydatidiform mole or non-mole miscarriage compared with women with no family history of mole or miscarriage. However, we did not find any unequivocal pathogenic mutations (the term unequivocal pathogenic mutations refers to mutations that indubitably have a pathogenic effect on the affected woman) in NLRP7 or C6orf221/KHDC3L in any of the women in the study group. This indicates that recurrent miscarriages plus hydatidiform mole, recurrent androgenetic hydatidiform moles and familial androgenetic hydatidiform moles in general do not have the same monogenetic etiology as familiar diploid biparental moles.

The western margin of the plain is the Helan mountain connecting a series of normal slip faults. The eastern margin of the plain connects with the Yellow River and adjacents with the Ordos platform. The south of the plain is bordered by the EN fault of the Niushou mountain. The bottom of the plain is the Carboniferous, Permian, or Ordovician rocks. Based on the analysis of groundwater hydrochemical and isotopic indicators, this study aims to identify the groundwater recharge and discharge in the Yinchuan plain, China. The hydrochemical types of the groundwater are HCO3-SO4 in the west, HCO3-Cl in the middle, and Cl-SO4 in the east. The hydrochemical types are HCO3-SO4 in the south, HCO3-Cl and SO4-HCO3 in the middle. The hydrochemical types are complex in the north, mainly SO4-HCO3 and Cl-SO4. Deuterium, O-18, and tritium values of groundwater indicate that groundwater recharge sources include precipitation, bedrock fissure water, and irrigation return water. Groundwater discharges include evaporation, abstraction, and discharge to surface water. According to the EW isotopic profile, the groundwater flow system (GFS) in the Yinchuan plain can be divided into local flow systems (LFS) and regional flow systems (RFS). Groundwater has lower TDS and higher tritium in the southern Yellow River alluvial plain and groundwater age ranges from 6 to 25 years. The range of groundwater renewal rates is from 11 to 15 % a(-1). The depth of the water cycle is small, and groundwater circulates fast and has high renewal rates. Groundwater has higher TDS and lower tritium in the northern Yellow River alluvial plain. The range of groundwater age is from 45 to 57 years, and renewal rate is from 6 to 0.1 % a(-1). The depth of the water cycle is larger. Groundwater circulates slowly and has low renewal rates.

In recent decades, E. faecium has been recognised as an opportunistic pathogen that causes diseases such as neonatal meningitis, urinary tract infections, bacteremia, bacterial endocarditis and diverticulitis. E. faecium could be taken into space with astronauts and exposed to the space environment. Thus, it is necessary to observe the phenotypic and molecular changes of E. faecium after spaceflight. Results: An E. faecium mutant with biochemical features that are different from those of the wild-type strain was obtained from subculture after flight on the SHENZHOU-8 spacecraft. To understand the underlying mechanism causing these changes, the whole genomes of both the mutant and the WT strains were sequenced using Illumina technology. The genomic comparison revealed that dprA, a recombination-mediator gene, and arpU, a gene associated with cell wall growth, were mutated. Comparative transcriptomic and proteomic analyses showed that differentially expressed genes or proteins were involved with replication, recombination, repair, cell wall biogenesis, glycometabolism, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, predicted general function and energy production/conversion. Conclusion: This study analysed the comprehensive genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic changes of an E. faecium mutant from subcultures that were loaded on the SHENZHOU-8 spacecraft. The implications of these gene mutations and expression changes and their underlying mechanisms should be investigated in the future. We hope that the current exploration of multiple "-omics" analyses of this E. faecium mutant will provide clues for future studies on this opportunistic pathogen.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of thalassemia and the mutation spectrum in Chongqing, the southern area of China. Methods: A total of 1057 children were recruited from Chongqing. Hematological parameters were examined and globin genes were genetically analyzed. Results: The total frequency of thalassemia carriers was 7.76% in this group of children. Among these, alpha-thalassemia was 520%, beta-thalassemia was 1.99% and abnormal hemoglobin variant was 0.57%. Furthermore, 24 cases of alpha-triplication were detected, frequency of which was 2.55%. The true prevalence of silent alpha-thalassemia was first reported in this study. In addition, six novel mutations that give rise to alpha-thalassemia and two rare abnormal hemoglobin variants were first identified in Chinese population. Conclusions: Our data suggested that the population in Chongqing are at high risk of alpha- and beta-thalassemia. The findings will be useful for genetic counseling and the prevention of severe thalassemias in this area. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Both drug resistance gene mutation detection and HBV genotyping are helpful for guiding clinical treatment. Total HBV DNA from 395 patients who were treated with single or multiple drugs including Lamivudine, Adefovir, Entecavir, Telbivudine, Tenofovir and Emtricitabine were sequenced using the HiSeq 2000 sequencing system and validated using the 3730 sequencing system. In addition, a mixed sample of HBV plasmid DNA was used to determine the cutoff value for HiSeq-sequencing, and 52 of the 395 samples were sequenced three times to evaluate the repeatability and stability of this technology. Of the 395 samples sequenced using both HiSeq and 3730 sequencing, the results from 346 were consistent, and the results from 49 were inconsistent. Among the 49 inconsistent results, 13 samples were detected as drug-resistance-positive using HiSeq but negative using 3730, and the other 36 samples showed a higher number of drug-resistance-positive gene mutations using HiSeq 2000 than using 3730. Gene mutations had an apparent frequency of 1% as assessed by the plasmid testing. Therefore, a 1% cutoff value was adopted. Furthermore, the experiment was repeated three times, and the same results were obtained in 49/52 samples using the HiSeq sequencing system.

Method Fetal chorionic villus samples were collected from 40 cases of spontaneous abortion with 22 different types of aneuploidy. Genomic DNA of each sample was extracted and sequenced on Illumina MiSeq platform. Unique reads of different read lengths were generated and analyzed using a z-score test. Results The entire test was finished in 48hours. An average of 102k unique reads was obtained for each sample, and all 40 different aneuploidy samples were correctly identified with a z-score of 3 or-3. No false positives or false negatives were observed. Further analysis demonstrated that read length and sequencing type (Paired-end or Single-end) significantly affects the efficiency of sex chromosomal aneuploidy detection. Paired-end 50bp reads displayed the highest mapping rate and is recommended for future large-scale clinical settings. Conclusion Ultra-low whole genome sequencing can rapidly detect aneuploidy of chromosomes in spontaneous abortion samples in less than 48hours and therefore can serve as an alternative option to current aneuploidy detection methods for aborted tissues.

Five probands with ataxia-telangectasia and 1 proband with chorea-acanthocytosis were analyzed by targeted gene sequencing. Whole-exome sequencing was used to investigate 3 affected individuals with Joubert syndrome, nemaline myopathy, or spastic ataxia Charlevoix-Saguenay type. A list of known and novel candidate variants was identified for each causative gene. All variants were genetically verified by Sanger sequencing or quantitative polymerase chain reaction with the strategy of disease segregation in related pedigrees and healthy controls. The advantages of using next-generation sequencing to diagnose rare autosomal recessive neurologic Mendelian disorders characterized by genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity are demonstrated. A genetic diagnostic strategy combining the use of targeted gene sequencing and whole-exome sequencing with the aid of next-generation sequencing platforms has shown great promise for improving the diagnosis of neurologic Mendelian disorders.

There are three other kinds of dwarfism (Pseudoachondroplasia, Achondroplasia and Thanatophoric Syndromes) with similar clinical features, which makes it difficult to give a precise diagnosis. Molecular genetic analysis of related genes should be employed. Methods: In this study, we reported a Chinese family diagnosed as a type of skeletal dysplasia based on clinical and radiologic findings. To make an accurate diagnosis quickly and economically, we performed microarray-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) to detect the variants in the disease-related genes (FGFR3 and COMP). Results: The mother presents short limbed stature, short iliac bones, short femoral necks, short stubby tibia and mildly increased fibular length and genu varum. Her fetus demonstrated abnormally short femur at 23 and 28 week's gestation by ultrasound scan, and was highly suspected with dwarfism. Eventually, a novel missense mutation (c.1024G > T) in FGFR3 was identified by next-generation sequencing. The substitution is found in both the mother and her fetus. The mutation was further confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Conclusions: This is the first report of missense mutation identified in the IgIll domain of the FGFR3 gene using NGS. Our results extended the mutational spectrum of FGFR3 and proved that applications of NGS and bioinfor-matics are effective methods for skeletal dysplasia diagnosis in clinical practices.

The appearance of drug-resistance mutants urgently requires novel inhibitors that act on non-active site of HIV-1 IN. Nanoparticles have such unique geometrical and chemical properties, which inspires us that nanoparticles like nanotubes may serve as better HIV-1 IN inhibitors than the conventional inhibitors. To test this hypothesis, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to study the binding of a carbon nanotube (CNT) to a full-length HIV-1 IN. The results showed that the CNT could stably bind to the C-terminal domain (CTD) of HIV-1 IN. The CNT also induced a domain-shift which disrupted the binding channel for viral DNA. Further MD simulation showed that a HIV-1 IN inhibitor, 5CITEP was successfully sealed inside the uncapped CNT. These results indicate that the CNT may serve as a potential dual-functional HIV-1 IN inhibitor, not only inducing conformation change as an allosteric inhibitor but also carrying small-molecular inhibitors as a drug delivery system.

Here, we report the development of an assay for this novel bunyavirus based on real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). The assay exhibited high sensitivity and specificity without cross-reactivity towards 13 other viruses that cause similar symptoms. To evaluate the performance of this assay in detecting clinical samples, we analysed 261 serum samples from patients in Henan Province between 2007 and 2010. Of these samples, 91.95% were bunyavirus positive. Compared with serological assays, the real-time PCR assay was much more sensitive in identifying infected patients 1 to 7 days after the onset of symptoms.

This study aimed to develop a novel method to determine zygosity by using maternal plasma target region sequencing. Methods: We constructed a statistic model to calculate the possibility of each zygosity type using likelihood ratios (Li) and empirical dynamic thresholds targeting at 4,524 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) loci on 22 autosomes. Then two dizygotic (DZ) twin pregnancies, two monozygotic (MZ) twin pregnancies and two singletons were recruited to evaluate the performance of our novel method. Finally we estimated the sensitivity and specificity of the model in silico under different cell-free fetal DNA (cff-DNA) concentration and sequence depth. Results/Conclusions: We obtained 8.90 Gbp sequencing data on average for six clinical samples. Two samples were classified as DZ with L values of 1.891 and 1.554, higher than the dynamic DZ cut-off values of 1.162 and 1.172, respectively. Another two samples were judged as MZ with 0.763 and 0.784 of L values, lower than the MZ cut-off values of 0.903 and 0.918. And the rest two singleton samples were regarded as MZ twins, with L values of 0.639 and 0.757, lower than the MZ cut-off values of 0.921 and 0.799. In silico, the estimated sensitivity of our noninvasive zygosity determination was 99.90% under 10% total cff-DNA concentration with 2 Gbp sequence data. As the cff-DNA concentration increased to 15%, the specificity was as high as 97% with 3.50 Gbp sequence data, much higher than 80% with 10% cff-DNA concentration. Significance: This study presents the feasibility to noninvasively determine zygosity of twin pregnancy using target region sequencing, and illustrates the sensitivity and specificity under various detecting condition. Our method can act as an alternative approach for zygosity determination of twin pregnancies in clinical practice.

In spite of the diversity of the clinical features, characterized by a mild movement disorder with cognitive impairment in the elder patient, and severe motor-neuron disease (MND) in her half-brother, the brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) features were compatible with adult-onset Alexander's disease (AOAD), suggesting different expression of the same, genetically determined, condition. Methods: Since mutations in the alpha isoform of glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP-alpha, the only cause so far known of AOAD, were excluded, we applied exome Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to identify gene variants, which were then functionally validated by molecular characterization of recombinant and patient-derived cells. Results: Exome-NGS revealed a mutation in a previously neglected GFAP isoform, GFAP-epsilon, which disrupts the GFAP-associated filamentous cytoskeletal meshwork of astrocytoma cells. To shed light on the different clinical features in the two patients, we sought for variants in other genes. The male patient had a mutation, absent in his half-sister, in X-linked histone deacetylase 6, a candidate MND susceptibility gene. Conclusions: Exome-NGS is an unbiased approach that not only helps identify new disease genes, but may also contribute to elucidate phenotypic expression.

This paper summarizes Chinese biobanks through investigation and survey on operative, managerial, ethical conditions and challenges of biobanks. At present, hospitals and research institutes in China set up and operate most of the biobanks, collecting human specimens to support clinical and scientific research. With the development of bio-industry and arrival of the big data era, biobanks need not only collect and store human and non-human specimens but also to manage the big data associated with these specimens.

Exome sequencing has high chromosomal coverage and accuracy, and has recently been successfully used to identify pathogenic gene mutations. In this study, exome sequencing followed by Sanger sequencing validation was first used to screen gene mutations in two representative MO patients from a Chinese family. After filtering the data from the 1000 Genome Project and the dbSNP database (build 132), the detected candidate gene mutations were further validated via Sanger sequencing of four other members of the same MO family and 200 unrelated healthy subjects. Immunohistochemisty and multiple sequence alignment were performed to evaluate the importance of the identified causal mutation. A novel frameshift mutation, c.1457insG at codon 486 of exon 6 of EXT1 gene, was identified, which truncated the glycosyltransferase domain of EXT1 gene. Multiple sequence alignment showed that codon 486 of EXT1 gene was highly conserved across various vertebrates. Immunohistochemisty demonstrated that the chondrocytes with functional EXT1 in MO were less than those in extragenetic solitary chondromas. The novel c.1457insG deleterious mutation of EXT1 gene reported in this study expands the causal mutation spectrum of MO, and may be helpful for prenatal genetic screening and early diagnosis of MO.

The goal of this study was to investigate a Chinese family with recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia, of which causative mutations could not be identified using the conventional PCR-based direct sequencing. Next-generation sequencing of all the transcripts of whole genome exome, after on-array hybrid capture, was performed on two affected male subjects (the proband and his brother). A missense mutation (c.1661G>A, p.R554H) was identified in ABCD1. Subsequently, PCR-based direct sequencing of other family members revealed that the mutation was co-segregating with the disease, indicating that ABCD1 mutation was the pathogenic event for this family. Very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) assay in the two affected cases confirmed X-ALD. Our study suggests exome sequencing can be used not only to find a novel causative gene, but also to quickly identify mutations of known genes when the clinical elements are etiologically misleading.

It is caused by HGD mutations, which leads to a deficiency in homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (HGD) activity. To date, several HGD mutations have been identified as the cause of the prototypic disease across different ethnic populations worldwide. However, in Asia, the HGD mutation is very rarely reported. For the Chinese population, no literature on HGD mutation screening is available to date. In this paper, we describe two novel HGD mutations in a Chinese AKU family, the splicing mutation of IVS7 + 1G>C, a donor splice site of exon 7, and a missense mutation of F329C in exon 12. The predicted new splicing site of the mutated exon 7 sequence demonstrated a 303 bp extension after the mutation site. The F329C mutation most probably disturbed the stability of the conformation of the two loops critical to the Fe2+ active site of the HGD enzyme. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Handmade Cloned Transgenic Sheep Rich in Omega-3 Fatty Acids	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CELL NUCLEAR TRANSFER; N-3 FATTY-ACIDS; MAMMALIAN-CELLS; HIGH-EFFICIENCY; IN-VITRO; CLONING; GENE; DESATURASE; FAT-1; SYSTEM	Technology of somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) has been adapted worldwide to generate transgenic animals, although the traditional procedure relies largely on instrumental micromanipulation. In this study, we used the modified handmade cloning (HMC) established in cattle and pig to produce transgenic sheep with elevated levels of omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids. Codon-optimized nematode mfat-1 was inserted into a eukaryotic expression vector and was transferred into the genome of primary ovine fibroblast cells from a male Chinese merino sheep. Reverse transcriptase PCR, gas chromatography, and chromosome analyses were performed to select nuclear donor cells capable of converting omega-6 (n-6) into n-3 fatty acids. Blastocysts developed after 7 days of in vitro culture were surgically transplanted into the uterus of female ovine recipients of a local sheep breed in Xinjiang. For the HMC, approximately 8.9% (n = 925) of reconstructed embryos developed to the blastocyst stage. Four recipients became pregnant after 53 blastocysts were transplanted into 29 naturally cycling females, and a total of 3 live transgenic lambs were produced. Detailed analyses on one of the transgenic lambs revealed a single integration of the modified nematode mfat-1 gene at sheep chromosome 5. The transgenic sheep expressed functional n-3 fatty acid desaturase, accompanied by more than 2-folds reduction of n-6/n-3 ratio in the muscle (p<0.01) and other major organs/tissues (p<0.05). To our knowledge, this is the first report of transgenic sheep produced by the HMC. Compared to the traditional SCNT method, HMC showed an equivalent efficiency but proved cheaper and easier in operation.

Zellweger syndrome (ZS) is the most common and severe phenotype in the heterogeneous ZSD. For the large number genes involved, it is difficult to make a precise genetic diagnosis by traditional methods at a time. A combination of enrichment of targeted genes and next-generation sequencing (NGS) would result in both high efficiency and low cost for targeted sequencing of genes of interest. Methods: To identify potential mutations in a Chinese family associated with Zellweger syndrome, 1930 kb of all the targeted region of PEX genes were captured and sequenced using NGS. We also performed Sanger sequencing to validate the NGS results. Results: Here, we reported a Chinese patient diagnosed as a severe classic type of PBD based on a clinical investigation. We then performed microarray-based NGS to detect the variants in PEX genes of the whole family. One reported heterozygosis mutation (c.782_783delAA) was identified in the patient's father and one novel heterozygosis missense mutation (c.475G>C) was found in the patient's mother, the patient inherited both mutations. Conclusions: The results proved that the application of target sequence capture using chip and high-throughput NGS is a valuable tool for the molecular diagnosis of peroxisome biogenesis disorders. The accuracy, high-throughput and speed of the method make it suitable for clinical application. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The objectives considered in this paper for minimization i.e. cost and emission are of conflicting nature, therefore weighting method has been applied to convert multiobjective optimization problem to a scalar optimization. The weighting method assigns different weights to each objective function based upon their importance. The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique has been applied to find the best comprised solution. The equality constraints have been handled by exterior penalty method. Fuzzy cardinal approach has been used for the evaluation of the best solution. In order to show the effectiveness, the proposed approach has been tested on three test systems. Numerical results obtained from the proposed approach are compared with different techniques.

To identify the genotype and characterize the phenotype in a Chinese HSP family, ten subjects from the family were examined through detailed clinical evaluations, auxiliary examinations and genetic tests. Using a combined approach of whole-exome sequencing and candidate mutation validation, we identified novel compound heterozygous mutations in the SPG11 gene of the patients as follows: a nonsense mutation c.6856C > T (p.R2286X) in exon 38 and a deletion mutation c.2863delG (p.Glu955Lysfs*8) in exon 16. Both mutations co-segregated with the phenotype in this family and were absent in 100 normal Chinese individuals. Our finding suggests that the novel compound heterozygous mutations in SPG11 are associated with HSP. We were able to assess the future risk of HSP in healthy younger family members using genetic detection, and provide prenatal diagnoses for the family members. Furthermore, to some extent this new finding enriches the information on SPG11 and may provide a new basis for the genetic diagnosis of HSP. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Recent advances in the high-throughput deep sequencing (HTS) technologies provide new leads in transcriptome analysis. Methods: By performing Solexa/Illumina's digital gene expression (DGE) profiling, we analyzed gene expression profiles of PBMCs from 6 quiescent (grade 0) and 6 rejection (grade 2R&3R) heart transplant recipients at more than 6 months after transplantation. Subsequently, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was carried out in an independent validation cohort of 47 individuals from three rejection groups (ISHLT, grade 0,1R, 2R&3R). Results: Through DGE sequencing and qPCR validation, 10 genes were identified as informative genes for detection of cardiac transplant rejection. A further clustering analysis showed that the 10 genes were not only effective for distinguishing patients with acute cardiac allograft rejection, but also informative for discriminating patients with renal allograft rejection based on both blood and biopsy samples. Moreover, PPI network analysis revealed that the 10 genes were connected to each other within a short interaction distance. Conclusions: We proposed a 10-gene signature for heart transplant patients at high-risk of developing severe rejection, which was found to be effective as well in other organ transplant. Moreover, we supposed that these genes function systematically as biomarkers in long-time allograft rejection. Further validation in broad transplant population would be required before the non-invasive biomarkers can be generally utilized to predict the risk of transplant rejection.

We report the draft genome sequences of two super-extensively drug-resistant M.tuberculosis isolates from China, FJ05194 (lineage 2) and GuangZ0019 (lineage 4), and compare them with the H37Rv reference strain to identify possible sources of genetic variation associated with their extensive drug resistance. Our results suggest that their extensive drug resistance probably results from the stepwise accumulation of resistances to individual drugs.

More than 90% of the sequence reads were mapped to the human reference genome. In subsequent analysis, we identified 3 224 311 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), of which 388 532 (12% of the total SNPs) had not been previously recorded in single nucleotide polymorphism database (dbSNP) or the 1000 Genomes Project database. The 5991 non-synonymous coding variants were screened for deleterious or disease-associated SNPs. Analysis of genes with deleterious SNPs identified 'retinoic acid signaling' and 'regulation of transcription' as the enriched Gene Ontology terms. Scanning of non-synonymous SNPs against the OMIM revealed several disease and phenotype-associated variants in Pakistani genome. Comparative analysis with Indian genome sequence revealed >1.8 million shared SNPs; 32% of which were annotated in similar to 14 000 genes. Gene Ontology (GO) terms analysis of these genes identified 'response to jasmonic acid stimulus', 'aminoglycoside antibiotic metabolic process' and 'glycoside metabolic process' with considerable enrichment. A total of 59 558 of small indels (1-5 bp) and 16 063 large structural variations were found; 54% of which was novel. Substantial number of novel structural variations discovered in Pakistani genome enforced previous inferences that (a) structural variations are major type of variation in the genome and (b) compared with SNPs, they putatively exhibit equivalent or superior functional roles. This genome sequence information will be an important reference for population-wide genomics studies of ethnically diverse South Asian subcontinent.

The two isolates were Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, nonmotile, facultatively anaerobic rods that were heterofermentative and did not exhibit catalase activity. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA, pheS and rpoA genes revealed that the two isolates shared 99.5, 99.8 and 99.9% sequence similarity, which indicates that they belong to the same species. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated clustering of the two isolates with the genus Lactobacillus. Strain LY-73(T) showed highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities with Lactobacillus harbinensis KACC 12409(T) (97.73%), Lactobacillus perolens DSM 12744(T) (96.96%) and Lactobacillus selangorensis DSM 13344(T) (93.10 %). Comparative analyses of their rpoA and pheS gene sequences indicated that the novel strains were significantly different from other Lactobacillus species. Low DNA DNA reassociation values (50.5 %) were obtained between strain LY-73(T) and its phylogenetically closest neighbours. The G+C contents of the DNA of the two novel isolates were 56.1 and 56.5 mol%. Straight-chain unsaturated fatty acids C-18:1 omega 9c (78.85 and 74.29%) were the dominant components, and the cell-wall peptidoglycan was of the L-Lys-D-Asp type. Based on phenotypic characteristics, and chemotaxonomic and genotypic data, the novel strains represent a novel species of the genus Lactobacillus, for which the name Lactobacillus shenzhenensis sp. nov. is proposed, with LY-73(T) (=CCTCC M2011481(T)=KACC 16878(T)) as the type strain.

Here we describe a patient presenting an early-onset congenital myopathy associated with a combination of well separated cap structures and nemaline bodies in his muscle biopsy. Exome sequencing analysis allowed us to identify a de novo missense mutation in the TPM3 gene. Our study confirms the extreme variability of morphological findings in TPM3-related myopathies, and proves that cap and nemaline bodies are two sides of the same 'coin'. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Up to now, 34 Campylobacter strains have been sequenced and published in public databases, providing good opportunity to systemically analyze their genomic diversities. In this study, we first conducted genomic characterization, which includes genome-wide alignments, pan-genome analysis, and phylogenetic identification, to depict the genetic diversity of Campylobacter genus. Afterward, we improved the tetranucleotide usage pattern-based naive Bayesian classifier to identify the abnormal composition fragments (ACFs, fragments with significantly different tetranucleotide frequency profiles from its genomic tetranucleotide frequency profiles) including horizontal gene transfers (HGTs) to explore the mechanisms for the genetic diversity of this organism. Finally, we analyzed the HGTs transferred via bacteriophage transductions. To our knowledge, this study is the first to use single nucleotide polymorphism information to construct liable microevolution phylogeny of 21 Campylobacter jejuni strains. Combined with the phylogeny of all the collected Campylobacter species based on genome-wide core gene information, comprehensive phylogenetic inference of all 34 Campylobacter organisms was determined. It was found that C. jejuni harbors a high fraction of ACFs possibly through intraspecies recombination, whereas other Campylobacter members possess numerous ACFs possibly via intragenus recombination. Furthermore, some Campylobacter strains have undergone significant ancient viral integration during their evolution process. The improved method is a powerful tool for bacterial genomic analysis.

The first bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) sequence of half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) containing the intact cyp19a1a gene was reported and the conservation and synteny of the cyp19a1a gene among teleosts were analyzed in the study. The BAC is 107 367 bp in size, with an overall guanine-cytosine (GC) content of 43.44%, and contains 4.38% transposable elements. Nine genes were predicted, including seven functional genes and two hypothetical genes. The cyp19a1a gene of all tested teleosts has nine exons and eight introns, and potential binding sites flanking the transcriptional start site are conserved. The expression pattern among teleosts is also similar during ovarian differentiation. Synteny analysis revealed a conserved gene cluster PKH4B-SL9A5-FHOD3-CEBPG-CEBPA among teleosts. These findings suggest that, among teleosts, cyp19a1a genes not only have similar genomic structures, but also have conserved functions. The genomic environment of cyp19a1a in tongue sole is not universal in teleosts, reflecting the particular evolution of tongue sole cyp19a1a after it diverged from the other teleosts.

Most studies of the MHC, and associated regions, focus on minor variants and HLA typing, many of which have been demonstrated to be associated with human disease susceptibility and metabolic pathways. However, the detection of variants in the MHC region, and diagnostic HLA typing, still lacks a coherent, standardized, cost effective and high coverage protocol of clinical quality and reliability. In this paper, we presented such a method for the accurate detection of minor variants and HLA types in the human MHC region, using high-throughput, high-coverage sequencing of target regions. A probe set was designed to template upon the 8 annotated human MHC haplotypes, and to encompass the 5 megabases (Mb) of the extended MHC region. We deployed our probes upon three, genetically diverse human samples for probe set evaluation, and sequencing data show that similar to 97% of the MHC region, and over 99% of the genes in MHC region, are covered with sufficient depth and good evenness. 98% of genotypes called by this capture sequencing prove consistent with established HapMap genotypes. We have concurrently developed a one-step pipeline for calling any HLA type referenced in the IMGT/HLA database from this target capture sequencing data, which shows over 96% typing accuracy when deployed at 4 digital resolution. This cost-effective and highly accurate approach for variant detection and HLA typing in the MHC region may lend further insight into immune-mediated diseases studies, and may find clinical utility in transplantation medicine research. This one-step pipeline is released for general evaluation and use by the scientific community.

Here, we describe a novel method that couples PCR with restriction endonuclease digestion (designated real-time digestion-PCR, or RTD-PCR) in a one-step reaction tube for detecting somatic mutations from a minority of cells. The PCR mixture contains a thermostable restriction enzyme that digests wild-type alleles during the PCR program, allowing selective amplification of the mutant alleles. To validate this method, we used real-time digestion-PCR for the specific detection of the EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) treatment resistance-inducing mutation, T790M, combining with three different platforms: Sanger sequencing, TaqMan probe PCR and Sequenom MassArray. From 78 clinical samples, seven T790M mutations were consistently detected on all three platforms, indicating that RTD-PCR may be a useful clinical tool for analyzing the T790M point mutation.

In topical treatment, high skin permeability and cellular uptake are key criteria for beneficial effects due to the natural barrier properties of skin. In this study, we wish to establish an in vivo model that allows the comparison of permeability and activity of vitamin D3 analogues in human skin. We generate a bipartite, genetic sensor technology that combines efficient lentivirus-directed gene delivery to xenotransplanted human skin with vitamin D3-induced expression of a luciferase reporter gene and live imaging of animals by bioluminescence imaging. Based on the induction of a transcriptional activator consisting of the vitamin D receptor fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain, the vitamin D3-responsive sensor facilitates non-invasive and rapid assessment of permeability and functional properties of vitamin D3 analogues. By topical application of a panel of vitamin D3 analogues onto 'sensorized' human skin, the sensor produces a drug-induced readout with a magnitude and persistence that allow a direct comparative analysis of different analogues. This novel genetic tool has great potential as a non-invasive in vivo screening system for further development and refinement of vitamin D3 analogues.

To counter this major erosion of biodiversity, we need to describe and monitor what we want to preserve. Unfortunately, the velocity of deforestation, ecosystem degradation and the escalating threat to the last wilderness areas on the planet overwhelm traditional taxonomists in their bid to describe all of Earth's biodiversity. Based on empirical studies on weevils and diving beetles (Coleoptera), we show that biodiversity assessments based on cox1 DNA sequence data deliver comparably accurate estimates of species diversity, even using a simple clustering method with a preset threshold. The method works best for large datasets, where lineage idiosyncratic errors such as species lumping or splitting compensate each other. Cox1 clusters cannot be translated into formal species per se, but can help taxonomists to accelerate their work. We suggest that large-scale sequencing campaigns for the Asian freshwater fauna will reveal patterns relevant for conservation priority setting, and enhance our understanding of macroevolutionary processes that have shaped current biodiversity in the region. Along with next generation sequencing approaches, we also suggest that our understanding of alpha taxonomy will benefit.	[Balke, Michael; Hendrich, Lars; Toussaint, Emmanuel F.

The homeostasis of circadian rhythms in both central and peripheral tissues is pivotal for numerous biological processes. Hence, biological rhythm disorders may contribute to the onset of cancers and metabolic disorders including obesity and type II diabetes, amongst others. A tight regulation of circadian clock effectors ensures a rhythmic expression profile of output genes which, depending on cell type, constitute about 3-20% of the transcribed mammalian genome. Central to this system is the negative regulator protein Cryptochrome 1 (CRY1) of which the dysfunction or absence has been linked to the pathogenesis of rhythm disorders. In this study, we generated transgenic Bama-minipigs featuring expression of the Cys414-Ala antimorphic human Cryptochrome 1 mutant (hCRY1(AP)). Using transgenic donor fibroblasts as nuclear donors, the method of handmade cloning (HMC) was used to produce reconstructed embryos, subsequently transferred to surrogate sows. A total of 23 viable piglets were delivered. All were transgenic and seemingly healthy. However, two pigs with high transgene expression succumbed during the first two months. Molecular analyzes in epidermal fibroblasts demonstrated disturbances to the expression profile of core circadian clock genes and elevated expression of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-alpha, known to be risk factors in cancer and metabolic disorders.

This event raised a serious public health crisis and caused more than two billion US dollars in economic losses. In this review, we describe the classification of E. coli, the Germany outbreak, and the characteristics and epidemical source-tracing of the causative agent. We also discuss the genomics analysis of the outbreak organism and propose an open-source genomics analysis as a new strategy in combating the emerging infectious diseases.

ReSeqTools: an integrated toolkit for large-scale next-generation sequencing based resequencing analysis	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Next-generation sequencing; Resequencing; Toolkit; Sequence variation	SHORT READ ALIGNMENT; GENOME SEQUENCE; DOMESTICATION; POPULATIONS; SELECTION	Large-scale next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based resequencing detects sequence variations, constructs evolutionary histories, and identifies phenotype-related genotypes. However, NGS-based resequencing studies generate extraordinarily large amounts of data, making computations difficult. Effective use and analysis of these data for NGS-based resequencing studies remains a difficult task for individual researchers. Here, we introduce ReSeqTools, a full-featured toolkit for NGS (Illumina sequencing)-based resequencing analysis, which processes raw data, interprets mapping results, and identifies and annotates sequence variations. ReSeqTools provides abundant scalable functions for routine resequencing analysis in different modules to facilitate customization of the analysis pipeline. ReSeqTools is designed to use compressed data files as input or output to save storage space and facilitates faster and more computationally efficient large-scale resequencing studies in a user-friendly manner. It offers abundant practical functions and generates useful statistics during the analysis pipeline, which significantly simplifies resequencing analysis. Its integrated algorithms and abundant sub-functions provide a solid foundation for special demands in resequencing projects. Users can combine these functions to construct their own pipelines for other purposes.

Solstices represent either the longest or shortest photoperiod of a year. OBJECTIVES: Intact and pinealectomized rats were used to investigate the potential changes of reproductive hormones in the hypothalamus-pituitary-testis (HPT) axis including GnRH, FSH, LH, testosterone and melatonin, and their receptors at summer solstice (SS) and winter solstices (WS). METHODS: The levels of reproductive hormones in HPT axis and the binding characteristics of their receptors were examined using radioimmunoassay and radioreceptor assay techniques, respectively. RESULTS: The results indicate that in the intact male rat, GnRH, LH and testosterone are higher at the SS than at the WS. However, FSH exhibited no significant seasonal changes. In the testis, B-max and K-d of LH receptors are higher at the WS than at the SS while those of FSH receptors are higher at the SS than at the WS. In addition, the melatonin in HPT axis appeared significant differences between WS and SS. B-max and K-d of melatonin receptors in the hypothalamus and pituitary also showed higher at the WS than at the SS. Moreover, reproductive hormone production lost their seasonal rhythms after pinealectomy. CONCLUSION: The most important discovery in this study is that we first reported that pinealectomy had profound effects on the binding characteristics of melatonin with its subtype receptors. Especially at the hypothalamus, the dominated melatonin receptors shifted from MT1 to MT2 after pinealectomy at the two solstices.

A SMP (Pif177) was identified previously from the nacreous layer of the Japanese pearl oyster Pinctada fucata, and its cleavage products (named pfPif97 and pfPif80 proteins) were found to bind to the chitin framework and induce aragonite crystal formation and orient the c axis. In this study, a homologue of pfPif177 was cloned from the mantle of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, containing the homologue of pfPif97 only and not pfPif80. This finding hints at the large divergence in gene structure between the two species. This homologue (cgPif97) shares characteristics with pfPif97, and suggests that the biological functions of these two proteins may be similar. The expression pattern of cgPif97 in different tissues and development stages indicates that it may play an important role in shell formation of the adult oyster. The morphology of the inner shell surface was affected by injected siRNA of cgPif97 and the calcite laths of the shell became thinner and narrower when the siRNA dose increased, suggesting that the cgPif97 gene plays an important role in calcite shell formation in C. gigas. In conclusion, we found evidence that the Pif177 gene evolved very fast but still retains a similar function among species [Current Zoology 59 (1): 109-115, 2013].

YHap: a population model for probabilistic assignment of Y haplogroups from re-sequencing data	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							TREE	Background: Y haplogroup analyses are an important component of genealogical reconstruction, population genetic analyses, medical genetics and forensics. These fields are increasingly moving towards use of low-coverage, high throughput sequencing. While there have been methods recently proposed for assignment of Y haplogroups on the basis of high-coverage sequence data, assignment on the basis of low-coverage data remains challenging. Results: We developed a new algorithm, YHap, which uses an imputation framework to jointly predict Y chromosome genotypes and assign Y haplogroups using low coverage population sequence data. We use data from the 1000 genomes project to demonstrate that YHap provides accurate Y haplogroup assignment with less than 2x coverage. Conclusions: Borrowing information across multiple samples within a population using an imputation framework enables accurate Y haplogroup assignment.

Despite the high heritability, the genetic basis for a majority of the ASDs remains elusive. The considerable clinical and genetic heterogeneity pose a significant challenge technically. State-of-the-art high-throughput sequencing (HTS), which makes the analyses of any specific single/multiple genes or whole exomes feasible, has shown a promising perspective in disease gene discovery. To date, numerous genetic studies using HTS have been reported and many rare inherited or de novo mutations have been identified. This review will focus on the progress and prospective of genome studies of ASDs using HTS.

There are various types of data in genomics research, most of which are stored as plain text tables. A data compression framework tailored to this file type is introduced in this paper, featuring a combination of generic compression algorithms, GPU acceleration, and column-major storage. This approach is the first to achieve both compression and decompression rates of around 100MB/s on commodity hardware without compromising compression ratio. By selecting appropriate compression schemes for each column of data, this framework efficiently exploits data redundancy while remaining applicable to a wide range of formats. The GPU-accelerated implementation also properly exploits the parallelism of compression algorithms. Finally, this paper presents a novel first-order Markov model based transformation, with evidence that it is at least as effective as Burrows-Wheeler and Move-To-Front in some contexts.

Now we analyze lung cancer patients' sputum samples Flora distribution and drug resistance and results are as follows. According to retrospective study, we analyzed lung cancer patients and identify the bacterial with routine sputum culture method strictly. At the same time, we use SPSS 19.0 soft to take a statistical analysis and judge flora drug resistance with CLSI. In the sputum culture, the rate of G- bacillus is 69.1% and it has high drug-resistance to cephalosporin, ampicillin and piperacillin, and it is sensitive to imipenem fairly. The rate of G(+) coccus is 10.1% and it is resistance to penicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin and erythromycin,and is sensitive to vancomycin. The rate of fungi is 20.8% and has obvious resistance to Pyrroles. The clinic should care more about the quality of the sputum samples, use targeted and reasonable antibiotics and control the flora drug-resistance.

Among the existing chemical sensors, optical planar sensors show promising and attempt to beat their commercialized competitors because of their robustness, lable-free detection mechanism, mature complementary metal oxide semiconductor (corns) fabrication technology and naturally low cost. Silicon nitride mirroring resonators were demonstrated as chemical sensors. Using the technique of corns technology, the microring devices were fabricated with 200 mu m in radius. Performance of the devices was measured, which showed the quality factor (q) was up to 25,000. Sensitivity of 108.9336 nm per reflective index unit (nm/riu) and detection limit of 1.836x10(-4) riu were demonstrated by using various concentrations of ethanol solution as analytes.
