Design We performed metagenome-wide association studies on faecal samples from 74 patients with CRC and 54 controls from China, and validated the results in 16 patients and 24 controls from Denmark. We further validated the biomarkers in two published cohorts from France and Austria. Finally, we employed targeted quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays to evaluate diagnostic potential of selected biomarkers in an independent Chinese cohort of 47 patients and 109 controls. Results Besides confirming known associations of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus stomatis with CRC, we found significant associations with several species, including Parvimonas micra and Solobacterium moorei. We identified 20 microbial gene markers that differentiated CRC and control microbiomes, and validated 4 markers in the Danish cohort. In the French and Austrian cohorts, these four genes distinguished CRC metagenomes from controls with areas under the receiver-operating curve (AUC) of 0.72 and 0.77, respectively. qPCR measurements of two of these genes accurately classified patients with CRC in the independent Chinese cohort with AUC=0.84 and OR of 23. These genes were enriched in early-stage (I-II) patient microbiomes, highlighting the potential for using faecal metagenomic biomarkers for early diagnosis of CRC. Conclusions We present the first metagenomic profiling study of CRC faecal microbiomes to discover and validate microbial biomarkers in ethnically different cohorts, and to independently validate selected biomarkers using an affordable clinically relevant technology. Our study thus takes a step further towards affordable non-invasive early diagnostic biomarkers for CRC from faecal samples.

Here we describe the correction of the heterozygous MYBPC3 mutation in human preimplantation embryos with precise CRISPR-Cas9-based targeting accuracy and high homology-directed repair efficiency by activating an endogenous, germline-specific DNA repair response. Induced double-strand breaks (DSBs) at the mutant paternal allele were predominantly repaired using the homologous wild-type maternal gene instead of a synthetic DNA template. By modulating the cell cycle stage at which the DSB was induced, we were able to avoid mosaicism in cleaving embryos and achieve a high yield of homozygous embryos carrying the wild-type MYBPC3 gene without evidence of off-target mutations. The efficiency, accuracy and safety of the approach presented suggest that it has potential to be used for the correction of heritable mutations in human embryos by complementing preimplantation genetic diagnosis. However, much remains to be considered before clinical applications, including the reproducibility of the technique with other heterozygous mutations.

Their large genomes are characterized by a high content of repetitive elements and large pericentromeric regions that are virtually devoid of meiotic recombination. Here we present a high-quality reference genome assembly for barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). We use chromosome conformation capture mapping to derive the linear order of sequences across the pericentromeric space and to investigate the spatial organization of chromatin in the nucleus at megabase resolution. The composition of genes and repetitive elements differs between distal and proximal regions. Gene family analyses reveal lineage-specific duplications of genes involved in the transport of nutrients to developing seeds and the mobilization of carbohydrates in grains. We demonstrate the importance of the barley reference sequence for breeding by inspecting the genomic partitioning of sequence variation in modern elite germplasm, highlighting regions vulnerable to genetic erosion.

Our study incorporates characterization at multiple levels-including phenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, chromosome segregation, and replication analysis-to provide a thorough and comprehensive analysis of a synthetic chromosome. Our Trans-Omics analyses reveal a modest but potentially relevant pervasive up-regulation of translational machinery observed in synII, mainly caused by the deletion of 13 transfer RNAs. By both complementation assays and SCRaMbLE (synthetic chromosome rearrangement and modification by loxP-mediated evolution), we targeted and debugged the origin of a growth defect at 37 degrees C in glycerol medium, which is related to misregulation of the high-osmolarity glycerol response. Despite the subtle differences, the synII strain shows highly consistent biological processes comparable to the native strain.

As parasitoids, predators, and pollinators, Hymenoptera play a fundamental role in virtually all terrestrial ecosystems and are of substantial economic importance [1, 3]. To understand the diversification and key evolutionary transitions of Hymenoptera, most notably from phytophagy to parasitoidism and predation (and vice versa) and from solitary to eusocial life, we inferred the phylogeny and divergence times of all major lineages of Hymenoptera by analyzing 3,256 protein-coding genes in 173 insect species. Our analyses suggest that extant Hymenoptera started to diversify around 281 million years ago (mya). The primarily ectophytophagous sawflies are found to be monophyletic. The species-rich lineages of parasitoid wasps constitute a monophyletic group as well. The little-known, species-poor Trigonaloidea are identified as the sister group of the stinging wasps (Aculeata). Finally, we located the evolutionary root of bees within the apoid wasp family `` Crabronidae.'' Our results reveal that the extant sawfly diversity is largely the result of a previously unrecognized major radiation of phytophagous Hymenoptera that did not lead to wood-dwelling and parasitoidism. They also confirm that all primarily parasitoid wasps are descendants of a single endophytic parasitoid ancestor that lived around 247 mya. Our findings provide the basis for a natural classification of Hymenoptera and allow for future comparative analyses of Hymenoptera, including their genomes, morphology, venoms, and parasitoid and eusocial life styles.

We designed and de novo synthesized 536,024-base pair chromosome synV in the " Build-A-Genome China" course. We corrected an initial isolate of synV to perfectly match the designed sequence using integrative cotransformation and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/ CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9)-mediated editing in 22 steps; synV strains exhibit high fitness under a variety of culture conditions, compared with that of wild-type V strains. A ring synV derivative was constructed, which is fully functional in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under all conditions tested and exhibits lower spore viability during meiosis. Ring synV chromosome can extends Sc2.0 design principles and provides a model with which to study genomic rearrangement, ring chromosome evolution, and human ring chromosome disorders.

As part of the effort to build a designer eukaryotic genome, yeast synthetic chromosome X (synX), designed as 707,459 base pairs, was synthesized chemically. SynX exhibited good fitness under a wide variety of conditions. A highly efficient mapping strategy called pooled PCRTag mapping (PoPM), which can be generalized to any watermarked synthetic chromosome, was developed to identify genetic alterations that affect cell fitness ("bugs"). A series of bugs were corrected that included a large region bearing complex amplifications, a growth defect mapping to a recoded sequence in FIP1, and a loxPsymsite affecting promoter function of ATP2. PoPM is a powerful tool for synthetic yeast genome debugging and an efficient strategy for phenotype-genotype mapping.

SynXII was assembled using a twostep method, specified by successive megachunk integration and meiotic recombinationmediated assembly, producing a functional chromosome in S. cerevisiae. Minor growth defect " bugs" detected in synXII, caused by deletion of tRNA genes, were rescued by introducing an ectopic copy of a single tRNA gene. The ribosomal gene cluster (rDNA) on synXII was left intact during the assembly process and subsequently replaced by a modified rDNA unit used to regenerate rDNA at three distinct chromosomal locations. The signature sequences within rDNA, which can be used to determine species identity, were swapped to generate a Saccharomyces synXII strain that would be identified as Saccharomyces bayanus by standard DNA barcoding procedures.

LARVAE; THYROID-HORMONE; RETINOIC ACID; METAMORPHOSIS; PIGMENTATION; RECEPTOR; EVOLUTION; PRODUCT; GENES	Flatfish have the most extreme asymmetric body morphology of vertebrates. During metamorphosis, one eye migrates to the contralateral side of the skull, and this migration is accompanied by extensive craniofacial transformations and simultaneous development of lopsided body pigmentation(1-5). The evolution of this developmental and physiological innovation remains enigmatic. Comparative genomics of two flatfish and transcriptomic analyses during metamorphosis point to a role for thyroid hormone and retinoic acid signaling, as well as phototransduction pathways. We demonstrate that retinoic acid is critical in establishing asymmetric pigmentation and, via cross-talk with thyroid hormones, in modulating eye migration. The unexpected expression of the visual opsins from the phototransduction pathway in the skin translates illumination differences and generates retinoic acid gradients that underlie the generation of asymmetry. Identifying the genetic underpinning of this unique developmental process answers long-standing questions about the evolutionary origin of asymmetry, but it also provides insight into the mechanisms that control body shape in vertebrates.

We report here the Hi-C-determined three-dimensional (3D) conformations of Sc2.0 chromosomes. The absence of repeats leads to a smoother contact pattern and more precisely tractable chromosome conformations, and the largescale genomic organization is globally unaffected by the presence of synthetic chromosome(s). Two exceptions are synIII, which lacks the silent mating-type cassettes, and synXII, specifically when the ribosomal DNA is moved to another chromosome. We also exploit the contact maps to detect rearrangements induced in SCRaMbLE (synthetic chromosome rearrangement and modification by loxP-mediated evolution) strains.

We performed a metagenome-wide association study and serum metabolomics profiling in a cohort of lean and obese, young, Chinese individuals. We identified obesity-associated gut microbial species linked to changes in circulating metabolites. The abundance of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a glutamate-fermenting commensal, was markedly decreased in obese individuals and was inversely correlated with serum glutamate concentration. Consistently, gavage with B. thetaiotaomicron reduced plasma glutamate concentration and alleviated diet-induced body-weight gain and adiposity in mice. Furthermore, weight-loss intervention by bariatric surgery partially reversed obesity-associated microbial and metabolic alterations in obese individuals, including the decreased abundance of B. thetaiotaomicron and the elevated serum glutamate concentration. Our findings identify previously unknown links between intestinal microbiota alterations, circulating amino acids and obesity, suggesting that it may be possible to intervene in obesity by targeting the gut microbiota.

However, the genetic basis and origination of human bladder cancer stem cells (BCSCs) remains unknown. Here, we conducted single-cell sequencing on 59 cells including BCSCs, bladder cancer non-stem cells (BCNSCs), bladder epithelial stem cells (BESCs) and bladder epithelial non-stem cells (BENSCs) from three bladder cancer (BC) specimens. Specifically, BCSCs demonstrate clonal homogeneity and suggest their origin from BESCs or BCNSCs through phylogenetic analysis. Moreover, 21 key altered genes were identified in BCSCs including six genes not previously described in BC (ETS1, GPRC5A, MKL1, PAWR, PITX2 and RGS9BP). Co-mutations of ARID1A, GPRC5A and MLL2 introduced by CRISPR/Cas9 significantly enhance the capabilities of self-renewal and tumor-initiating of BCNSCs. To our knowledge, our study first provides an overview of the genetic basis of human BCSCs with single-cell sequencing and demonstrates the biclonal origin of human BCSCs via evolution analysis.

The Expanding Family of Natural Anion Channelrhodopsins Reveals Large Variations in Kinetics, Conductance, and Spectral Sensitivity	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							PROTEOMONAS-SULCATA; SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; CHLORIDE CHANNEL; LIGHT; OPTOGENETICS; PERFORMANCE; PHOTOCYCLE; RHODOPSINS; MODELS	Natural anion channelrhodopsins (ACRs) discovered in the cryptophyte alga Guillardia theta generate large hyperpolarizing currents at membrane potentials above the Nernst equilibrium potential for Cland thus can be used as efficient inhibitory tools for optogenetics. We have identified and characterized new ACR homologs in different cryptophyte species, showing that all of them are anion-selective, and thus expanded this protein family to 20 functionally confirmed members. Sequence comparison of natural ACRs and engineered Cl--conducting mutants of cation channelrhodopsins (CCRs) showed radical differences in their anion selectivity filters. In particular, the Glu90 residue in channelrhodopsin 2, which needed to be mutated to a neutral or alkaline residue to confer anion selectivity to CCRs, is nevertheless conserved in all of the ACRs identified. The new ACRs showed a large variation of the amplitude, kinetics, and spectral sensitivity of their photocurrents. A notable variant, designated "ZipACR", is particularly promising for inhibitory optogenetics because of its combination of larger current amplitudes than those of previously reported ACRs and an unprecedentedly fast conductance cycle (current half-decay time 2-4 ms depending on voltage). ZipACR expressed in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons enabled precise photoinhibition of individual spikes in trains of up to 50 Hz frequency.

Genome assembly with in vitro proximity ligation data and whole-genome triplication in lettuce	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; FAMILIES DATABASE; GENE FAMILY; RNA GENES; EVOLUTION; DNA; PROTEIN; PLANTS; COMPOSITAE; SECONDARY	Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) is a major crop and a member of the large, highly successful Compositae family of flowering plants. Here we present a reference assembly for the species and family. This was generated using whole-genome shotgun Illumina reads plus in vitro proximity ligation data to create large superscaffolds; it was validated genetically and superscaffolds were oriented in genetic bins ordered along nine chromosomal pseudomolecules. We identify several genomic features that may have contributed to the success of the family, including genes encoding Cycloidea-like transcription factors, kinases, enzymes involved in rubber biosynthesis and disease resistance proteins that are expanded in the genome. We characterize 21 novel microRNAs, one of which may trigger phasiRNAs from numerous kinase transcripts. We provide evidence for a whole-genome triplication event specific but basal to the Compositae. We detect 26% of the genome in triplicated regions containing 30% of all genes that are enriched for regulatory sequences and depleted for genes involved in defence.

Molecular analysis of urothelial cancer cell lines for modeling tumor biology and drug response	ONCOGENE			English	Article							INVASIVE BLADDER-CANCER; WHOLE-GENOME; IMPACT ANALYSIS; ANNOTATION; IDENTIFICATION; VISUALIZATION; SENSITIVITY; RESOURCE; GENES; CHEMOSENSITIVITY	The utility of tumor-derived cell lines is dependent on their ability to recapitulate underlying genomic aberrations and primary tumor biology. Here, we sequenced the exomes of 25 bladder cancer (BCa) cell lines and compared mutations, copy number alterations (CNAs), gene expression and drug response to BCa patient profiles in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We observed a mutation pattern associated with altered CpGs and APOBEC-family cytosine deaminases similar to mutation signatures derived from somatic alterations in muscle-invasive (Ml) primary tumors, highlighting a major mechanism(s) contributing to cancer associated alterations in the BCa cell line exomes. Non-silent sequence alterations were confirmed in 76 cancer-associated genes, including mutations that likely activate oncogenes TERT and PIK3CA, and alter chromatin-associated proteins (MLL3, ARID1A, CHD6 and KDM6A) and established BCa genes (TP53, RB1, CDKN2A and TSC1). We identified alterations in signaling pathways and proteins with related functions, including the PI3K/mTOR pathway, altered in 60% of lines; BRCA DNA repair, 44%; and SYNE1-SYNE2, 60%. Homozygous deletions of chromosome 9p21 are known to target the cell cycle regulators CDKN2A and CDKN2B. This loci was commonly lost in BCa cell lines and we show the deletions extended to the polyamine enzyme methylthioadenosine (MTA) phosphorylase (MTAP) in 36% of lines, transcription factor DMRTA1 (27%) and antiviral interferon epsilon (IFNE, 19%). Overall, the BCa cell line genomic aberrations were concordant with those found in BCa patient tumors. We used gene expression and copy number data to infer pathway activities for cell lines, then used the inferred pathway activities to build a predictive model of cisplatin response. When applied to platinum-treated patients gathered from TCGA, the model predicted treatment-specific response. Together, these data and analysis represent a valuable community resource to model basic tumor biology and to study the pharmacogenomics of BCa.	[Nickerson, M.

SCIENTIFIC DATA			English	Article; Data Paper							BACTERIAL ARTIFICIAL CHROMOSOMES; PHYSICAL MAP; LIBRARIES; GENERATION; ASSEMBLIES; FRAMEWORK; ALIGNMENT; BIAS	Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is a cereal grass mainly used as animal fodder and raw material for the malting industry. The map-based reference genome sequence of barley cv. `Morex' was constructed by the International Barley Genome Sequencing Consortium (IBSC) using hierarchical shotgun sequencing. Here, we report the experimental and computational procedures to (i) sequence and assemble more than 80,000 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones along the minimum tiling path of a genome-wide physical map, (ii) find and validate overlaps between adjacent BACs, (iii) construct 4,265 non-redundant sequence scaffolds representing clusters of overlapping BACs, and (iv) order and orient these BAC clusters along the seven barley chromosomes using positional information provided by dense genetic maps, an optical map and chromosome conformation capture sequencing (Hi-C). Integrative access to these sequence and mapping resources is provided by the barley genome explorer (BARLEX).

To dissociate changes in the gut microbiota associated with high HF feeding from those associated with obesity, we took advantage of the different susceptibility of C57BL/6JBomTac (BL6) and 129S6/SvEvTac (Sv129) mice to diet-induced obesity and of their different responses to inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) activity, where inhibition of COX activity in BL6 mice prevents HF diet-induced obesity, but in Sv129 mice accentuates obesity. Results: Using HiSeq-based whole genome sequencing, we identified taxonomic and functional differences in the gut microbiota of the two mouse strains fed regular low-fat or HF diets with or without supplementation with the COX-inhibitor, indomethacin. HF feeding rather than obesity development led to distinct changes in the gut microbiota. We observed a robust increase in alpha diversity, gene count, abundance of genera known to be butyrate producers, and abundance of genes involved in butyrate production in Sv129 mice compared to BL6 mice fed either a LF or a HF diet. Conversely, the abundance of genes involved in propionate metabolism, associated with increased energy harvest, was higher in BL6 mice than Sv129 mice. Conclusions: The changes in the composition of the gut microbiota were predominantly driven by high-fat feeding rather than reflecting the obese state of the mice. Differences in the abundance of butyrate and propionate producing bacteria in the gut may at least in part contribute to the observed differences in obesity propensity in Sv129 and BL6 mice.

FReJA Consortium	Patient iPSC-Derived Neurons for Disease Modeling of Frontotemporal Dementia with Mutation in CHMP2B	STEM CELL REPORTS			English	Article							ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; APOLIPOPROTEIN-E; CELLS; MITOCHONDRIA; EXPRESSION; PATHOLOGY; TOXICITY; PROMOTES; DEFICITS	The truncated mutant form of the charged multivesicular body protein 2B (CHMP2B) is causative for frontotemporal dementia linked to chromosome 3 (FTD3). CHMP2B is a constituent of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) and, when mutated, disrupts endosome-to-lysosome trafficking and substrate degradation. To understand the underlying molecular pathology, FTD3 patient induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were differentiated into forebrain-type cortical neurons. FTD3 neurons exhibited abnormal endosomes, as previously shown in patients. Moreover, mitochondria of FTD3 neurons displayed defective cristae formation, accompanied by deficiencies in mitochondrial respiration and increased levels of reactive oxygen. In addition, we provide evidence for perturbed iron homeostasis, presenting an in vitro patient-specific model to study the effects of iron accumulation in neurodegenerative diseases. All phenotypes observed in FTD3 neurons were rescued in CRISPR/Cas9-edited isogenic controls. These findings illustrate the relevance of our patient-specific in vitro models and open up possibilities for drug target development.

To investigate the molecular bases of carnivory, we sequenced the genome of the heterophyllous pitcher plant Cephalotus follicularis, in which we succeeded in regulating the developmental switch between carnivorous and non-carnivorous leaves. Transcriptome comparison of the two leaf types and gene repertoire analysis identified genetic changes associated with prey attraction, capture, digestion and nutrient absorption. Analysis of digestive fluid proteins from C. follicularis and three other carnivorous plants with independent carnivorous origins revealed repeated co-options of stress-responsive protein lineages coupled with convergent amino acid substitutions to acquire digestive physiology. These results imply constraints on the available routes to evolve plant carnivory.

An accurate orthology assignment is a crucial step for comparative genomic studies. Orthologous genes in two organisms can be identified by applying a so-called reciprocal search strategy, given that complete information of the organisms' gene repertoire is available. In many investigations, however, only a fraction of the gene content of the organisms under study is examined (e.g., RNA sequencing). Here, identification of orthologous nucleotide or amino acid sequences can be achieved using a graph-based approach that maps nucleotide sequences to genes of known orthology. Existing implementations of this approach, however, suffer from algorithmic issues that may cause problems in downstream analyses. Results: We present a new software pipeline, Orthograph, that addresses and solves the above problems and implements useful features for a wide range of comparative genomic and transcriptomic analyses. Orthograph applies a best reciprocal hit search strategy using profile hidden Markov models and maps nucleotide sequences to the globally best matching cluster of orthologous genes, thus enabling researchers to conveniently and reliably delineate orthologs and paralogs from transcriptomic and genomic sequence data. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on de novo-sequenced and assembled transcript libraries of 24 species of apoid wasps (Hymenoptera: Aculeata) as well as on published genomic datasets. Conclusion: With Orthograph, we implemented a best reciprocal hit approach to reference-based orthology prediction for coding nucleotide sequences such as RNAseq data. Orthograph is flexible, easy to use, open source and freely available at https://mptrsen. github. io/Orthograph. Additionally, we release 24 de novo-sequenced and assembled transcript libraries of apoid wasp species.

This randomized, controlled trial aimed to compare the effects of conventional treatment alone (control) with additional treatment with FMT (intervention) in patients with slow -transit constipation (STC). Adults with STC were randomized to receive intervention or control treatment. The control group received education, behavioral strategies, and oral laxatives. The intervention group was additionally provided 6 days of FMT. The primary endpoint was the clinical cure rate (proportion of patients achieving a mean of > three complete spontaneous bowel movements [CSBMs] per week]. Secondary outcomes and safety parameters were assessed throughout the study. Sixty patients were randomized to either conventional treatment alone (n = 30) or FMT (n = 30) through a nasointestinal tube. There were significant differences between the intervention group and control group in the clinical improvement rate (intention -to -treat [ITT]: 53.3% vs. 20.0%, P= 0.009), clinical cure rate (ITT: 36.7% vs. 13.3%, P= 0.04), mean number of CSBMs per week (ITT: 3.2 1.4 vs. 2.1 1.2, P = 0.001), and the Wexner constipation score (ITT: 8.6 1.5 vs. 12.7 2.5, P< 0.00001). Compared with the control group, the intervention group showed better results in the stool consistency score (ITT: 3.9 vs. 2.4, P< 0.00001) and colonic transit time (ITT: 58.5 vs. 73.6 h, P< 0.00001). The intervention group had more treatment-related adverse events than did the control group (50 vs. 4 cases). FMT was significantly more effective (30% higher cure rate) for treatment of STC than conventional treatment. No serious adverse events were observed.

The regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins are key interactors and critical modulators of the G alpha protein of the heterotrimer. However, while G-proteins are widespread in plants, RGS proteins have been reported to be missing from the entire monocot lineage, with two exceptions. A single amino acid substitution-based adaptive coevolution of the G alpha:RGS proteins was proposed to enable the loss of RGS in monocots. We used a combination of evolutionary and biochemical analyses and homology modeling of the G alpha and RGS proteins to address their expansion and its potential effects on the G-protein cycle in plants. Our results show that RGS proteins are widely distributed in the monocot lineage, despite their frequent loss. There is no support for the adaptive coevolution of the G alpha:RGS protein pair based on single amino acid substitutions. RGS proteins interact with, and affect the activity of, G alpha proteins from species with or without endogenous RGS. This cross-functional compatibility expands between the metazoan and plant kingdoms, illustrating striking conservation of their interaction interface. We propose that additional proteins or alternative mechanisms may exist which compensate for the loss of RGS in certain plant species.

To identify the HLA risk alleles associated with phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R)-related MN in the Chinese population, we sequenced the entire MHC region in DNA samples from 99 patients with PLA2R-related MN, 50 patients with PLA2R-unrelated MN, and 100 healthy subjects. Two HLA risk alleles, HLA-DRB1*15:01 and HLA-DRB3*02:02, independently and strongly associated with an increased risk of PLA2R-related MN. After adjusting for HLA-DRB1*15:01 and HLA-DRB3*02:02, no other alleles showed significant association with PLA2R-related MN. A replication study in an independent cohort of 293 participants with PLA2R-related MN and 285 healthy controls validated these findings. In a joint analysis, a multivariate logistic regression model confirmed that HLA-DRB1*15:01 (odds ratio [OR], 24.9; 95% confidence interval [95% Cl], 15.3 to 42.6; P=2.3x10(-35)) and HLA-DRB3*02:02 (OR, 17.7; 95% CI, 11.0 to 30.3; P=8.0x10(-29)) independently and strongly associated with PLA2R-related MN. As many as 98.7% of patients with PLA2R-related MN, compared with 43.9% of control subjects, carried at least one HLA risk allele. Subjects with either risk allele had higher odds of developing PLA2R-related MN than those without a risk allele (OR, 98.9; 95% CI, 44.4 to 281.7; P=2.5x10(-23)). These HLA risk alleles also associated with the age at disease onset in patients with PLA2R-related MN. In conclusion, our findings provide clear evidence that the HLA-DRB1*15:01 and HLA-DRB3*02:02 alleles independently and strongly associate with PLA2R-related MN in the Chinese population.

The large amount of data generated from mass spectrometry requires intensive computational processing for annotation of mass spectra and identification of metabolites. Computational analysis tools that are fully integrated with multiple functions and are easily operated by users who lack extensive knowledge in programing are needed in this research field. Results: We herein developed an R package, metaX, that is capable of end-to-end metabolomics data analysis through a set of interchangeable modules. Specifically, metaX provides several functions, such as peak picking and annotation, data quality assessment, missing value imputation, data normalization, univariate and multivariate statistics, power analysis and sample size estimation, receiver operating characteristic analysis, biomarker selection, pathway annotation, correlation network analysis, and metabolite identification. In addition, metaX offers a webbased interface ( http://metax.genomics.cn) for data quality assessment and normalization method evaluation, and it generates an HTML-based report with a visualized interface. The metaX utilities were demonstrated with a published metabolomics dataset on a large scale. The software is available for operation as either a web-based graphical user interface ( GUI) or in the form of command line functions. The package and the example reports are available at http://metax.genomics.cn/. Conclusions: The pipeline of metaX is platform-independent and is easy to use for analysis of metabolomics data generated from mass spectrometry.

Quantitative Whole Genome Sequencing of Circulating Tumor Cells Enables Personalized Combination Therapy of Metastatic Cancer	CANCER RESEARCH			English	Article							COMPREHENSIVE MOLECULAR PORTRAITS; BREAST-CANCER; PROSTATE-CANCER; MUTATIONS; DNA; MEDICINE; BIOPSIES	Much effort has been dedicated to developing circulating tumor cells (CTC) as a noninvasive cancer biopsy, but with limited success as yet. In this study, we combine a method for isolation of highly pure CTCs using immunomagnetic enrichment/fluorescence-activated cell sorting with advanced whole genome sequencing (WGS), based on long fragment read technology, to illustrate the utility of an accurate, comprehensive, phased, and quantitative genomic analysis platform for CTCs. Whole genomes of 34 CTCs from a patient with metastatic breast cancer were analyzed as 3,072 barcoded subgenomic compartments of long DNA. WGS resulted in a read coverage of 23 x per cell and an ensemble call rate of > 95%. These barcoded reads enabled accurate detection of somatic mutations present in as few as 12% of CTCs. We found in CTCs a total of 2,766 somatic single-nucleotide variants and 543 indels and multi-base substitutions, 23 of which altered amino acid sequences. Another 16,961 somatic single nucleotide variant and 8,408 indels and multi-base substitutions, 77 of which were nonsynonymous, were detected with varying degrees of prevalence across the 34 CTCs. On the basis of our whole genome data of mutations found in all CTCs, we identified driver mutations and the tissue of origin of these cells, suggesting personalized combination therapies beyond the scope of most gene panels. Taken together, our results show how advanced WGS of CTCs can lead to high-resolution analyses of cancers that can reliably guide personalized therapy. (C) 2017 AACR.

Circulating cell-free DNAs (cfDNA) may contain a more complete mutational spectrum compared to a single tumor sample. This study aimed to identify the most efficient strategy to identify all the mutations within heterogeneous HCCs. Methods: Whole exome sequencing (WES) and targeted deep sequencing (TDS) were carried out in 32 multi-regional tumor samples from five patients. Matched preoperative cfDNAs were sequenced accordingly. Intratumoral heterogeneity was measured using the average percentage of non-ubiquitous mutations (present in parts of tumor regions). Profiling efficiencies of single tumor specimen and cfDNA were compared. The strategy with the highest performance was used to screen for actionable mutations. Results: Variable levels of heterogeneity with branched and parallel evolution patterns were observed. The heterogeneity decreased at higher sequencing depth of TDS compared to measurements by WES (28.1% vs. 34.9%, p <0.01) but remained unchanged when additional samples were analyzed. TDS of single tumor specimen identified an average of 70% of the total mutations from multi-regional tissues. Although genome profiling efficiency of cfDNA increased with sequencing depth, an average of 47.2% total mutations were identified using TDS, suggesting that tissue samples outperformed it. TDS of single tumor specimen in 66 patients and cfDNAs in four unresectable HCCs showed that 38.6% (26/66 and 1/4) of patients carried mutations that were potential therapeutic targets. Conclusions: TDS of single tumor specimen could identify actionable mutations targets for therapy in HCC. cfDNA may serve as secondary alternative in profiling HCC genome. Lay summary: Targeted deep sequencing of single tumor specimen is a more efficient method to identify mutations in hepatocellular carcinoma made from mixed subtypes compared to circulating cell-free DNA in blood. cfDNA may serve as secondary alternative in profiling HCC genome. Identifying mutations may help clinicians choose targeted therapy for better individual treatments. (C) 2017 European Association for the Study of the Liver. Published by Elsevier B.V.

New approaches for disseminating data, methods and results are required to maximize knowledge discovery. The "long tail" of small, unstructured datasets is well catered for by a number of general-purpose repositories, but there has been less support for "big data". Outlined here are our experiences in attempting to tackle the gaps in publishing large-scale, computationally intensive research. GigaScience is an open-access, open-data journal aiming to revolutionize large-scale biological data dissemination, organization and re-use. Through use of the data handling infrastructure of the genomics centre BGI, GigaScience links standard manuscript publication with an integrated database (GigaDB) that hosts all associated data, and provides additional data analysis tools and computing resources. Furthermore, the supporting workflows and methods are also integrated to make published articles more transparent and open. GigaDB has released many new and previously unpublished datasets and data types, including as urgently needed data to tackle infectious disease outbreaks, cancer and the growing food crisis. Other "executable" research objects, such as workflows, virtual machines and software from several GigaScience articles have been archived and shared in reproducible, transparent and usable formats. With data citation producing evidence of, and credit for, its use in the wider research community, GigaScience demonstrates a move towards more executable publications. Here data analyses can be reproduced and built upon by users without coding backgrounds or heavy computational infrastructure in a more democratized manner.

Samples are collected from 58 hospitals from 23 provinces around China. We are able to call 22 million high quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) from the nuclear genome, representing the largest SNP call set from an East Asian population to date. We use these variants for imputation of genotypes across all samples, and this has allowed us to perform a successful genome wide association study (GWAS) on MDD. The utility of these data can be extended to studies of genetic ancestry in the Han Chinese and evolutionary genetics when integrated with data from other populations. Molecular phenotypes, such as copy number variations and structural variations can be detected, quantified and analysed in similar ways.

The human ortholog is, however, mostly retained intracellularly in contrast to the cell surface-expressed murine and goldfish orthologs. The latter orthologs are G(q)-coupled and lead to intracellular accumulation of inositol phosphates and calcium release. In the present study we cloned the bonobo chimpanzee GPRC6A receptor, which is 99% identical to the human receptor, and show that it is cell surface-expressed and functional. By analyses of chimeric human/mouse and human/bonobo receptors, bonobo receptor mutants, and the single nucleotide polymorphism database at NCBI, we identify an insertion/deletion variation in the third intracellular loop responsible for the intracellular retention and lack of function of the human ortholog. Genetic analyses of the 1000 genome database and the Inter99 cohort of 6,000 Danes establish the distribution of genotypes among ethnic groups, showing that the cell surface-expressed and functional variant is much more prevalent in the African population than in European and Asian populations and that this variant is partly linked with a stop codon early in the receptor sequence (rs6907580, amino acid position 57). In conclusion, our data solve a more than decade-old question of why the cloned human GPRC6A receptor is not cell surface-expressed and functional and provide a genetic framework to study human phenotypic traits in large genome sequencing projects linked with physiological measurement and biomarkers.

However, it is not known whether clinical efficacy differs by route of delivery. OBJECTIVE To determine whether FMT by oral capsule is noninferior to colonoscopy delivery in efficacy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Noninferiority, unblinded, randomized trial conducted in 3 academic centers in Alberta, Canada. A total of 116 adult patients with RCDI were enrolled between October 2014 and September 2016, with follow-up to December 2016. The noninferiority margin was 15%. INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomly assigned to FMT by capsule or by colonoscopy at a 1: 1 ratio. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomewas the proportion of patients without RCDI 12 weeks after FMT. Secondary outcomes included (1) serious and minor adverse events, (2) changes in quality of life by the 36-Item Short Form Survey on a scale of 0 (worst possible quality of life) to 100 (best quality of life), and (3) patient perception on a scale of 1 (not at all unpleasant) to 10 (extremely unpleasant) and satisfaction on a scale of 1 (best) to 10 (worst). RESULTS Among 116 patients randomized (mean [SD] age, 58 [19] years; 79 women [68%]), 105 (91%) completed the trial, with 57 patients randomized to the capsule group and 59 to the colonoscopy group. In per-protocol analysis, prevention of RCDI after a single treatment was achieved in 96.2% in both the capsule group (51/53) and the colonoscopy group (50/52) (difference, 0%; 1-sided 95% CI, -6.1% to infinity; P < .001), meeting the criterion for noninferiority. One patient in each group died of underlying cardiopulmonary illness unrelated to FMT. Rates of minor adverse events were 5.4% for the capsule group vs 12.5% for the colonoscopy group. There was no significant between-group difference in improvement in quality of life. A significantly greater proportion of participants receiving capsules rated their experience as "not at all unpleasant" (66% vs 44%; difference, 22% [95% CI, 3%-40%]; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adults with RCDI, FMT via oral capsules was not inferior to delivery by colonoscopy for preventing recurrent infection over 12 weeks. Treatment with oral capsulesmay be an effective approach to treating RCDI.

Targeted proteomics has emerged as a powerful approach for reproducible quantification but is limited in the number of proteins quantified. SWATH-mass spectrometry consists of data-independent acquisition and a targeted data analysis strategy that aims to maintain the favorable quantitative characteristics (accuracy, sensitivity, and selectivity) of targeted proteomics at large scale. While previous SWATH-mass spectrometry studies have shown high intra-lab reproducibility, this has not been evaluated between labs. In this multi-laboratory evaluation study including 11 sites worldwide, we demonstrate that using SWATH-mass spectrometry data acquisition we can consistently detect and reproducibly quantify >4000 proteins from HEK293 cells. Using synthetic peptide dilution series, we show that the sensitivity, dynamic range and reproducibility established with SWATH-mass spectrometry are uniformly achieved. This study demonstrates that the acquisition of reproducible quantitative proteomics data by multiple labs is achievable, and broadly serves to increase confidence in SWATH-mass spectrometry data acquisition as a reproducible method for large-scale protein quantification.

Genetic variation is identified mainly by mapping short reads to the reference genome or by performing local assembly(2,5-7). However, these approaches are biased against discovery of structural variants and variation in the more complex parts of the genome. Hence, large-scale de novo assembly is needed. Here we show that it is possible to construct excellent de novo assemblies from high-coverage sequencing with mate-pair libraries extending up to 20 kilobases. We report de novo assemblies of 150 individuals (50 trios) from the GenomeDenmark project. The quality of these assemblies is similar to those obtained using the more expensive long-read technology(4,8-13). We use the assemblies to identify a rich set of structural variants including many novel insertions and demonstrate how this variant catalogue enables further deciphering of known association mapping signals. We leverage the assemblies to provide 100 completely resolved major histocompatibility complex haplotypes and to resolve major parts of the Y chromosome. Our study provides a regional reference genome that we expect will improve the power of future association mapping studies and hence pave the way for precision medicine initiatives, which now are being launched in many countries including Denmark.

Soybean is an ancient tetraploid, which underwent two whole genome duplications. Most of soybean genes are paralogous genes with multiple copies. Although many circRNAs have been identified in animals and plants, little is known about soybean circRNAs, especially about circRNAs derived from paralogous genes. Here, we used deep sequencing technology coupled with RNase R enrichment strategy and bioinformatic approach to uncover circRNAs in soybean. A total of 5,372 circRNAs were identified, approximately 80% of which were paralogous circRNAs generated from paralogous genes. Despite high sequence homology, the paralogous genes could produce different paralogous circRNAs with different expression patterns. Two thousand and one hundred thirty four circRNAs were predicted to be 92 miRNAs target mimicry. CircRNAs and circRNA isoforms exhibited tissue-specific expression patterns in soybean. Based on the function of circRNA-host genes, the soybean circRNAs may participate in many biological processes such as developmental process, multiorganism process, and metabolic process. Our study not only provided a basis for research into the function of circRNAs in soybean but also new insights into the plant circRNA kingdom.

Here, we investigate the effect of chromatin accessibility on Cas9-mediated gene editing efficiency for 20 gRNAs targeting 10 genomic loci in HEK293T cells using both SpCas9 and the eSpCas9(1.1) variant. Our study indicates that gene editing is more efficient in euchromatin than in heterochromatin, and we validate this finding in HeLa cells and in human fibroblasts. Furthermore, we investigate the gRNA sequence determinants of CRISPR-Cas9 activity using a surrogate reporter system and find that the efficiency of Cas9-mediated gene editing is dependent on guide sequence secondary structure formation. This knowledge can aid in the further improvement of tools for gRNA design.

Using high-throughput DNA sequencing, 28 nephrotic syndrome-related genes were analyzed in 110 chil-dren affected by SRNS and 10 children with isolated proteinuria enrolled by 5 centers in China (67 boys, 53 girls). Their age at disease onset ranged from 1 day to 208 months (median, 48.8 months). Patients were excluded if their age at onset of disease was over 18 years or if they were diagnosed as having Alport syndrome. A genetic etiology was identified in 28.3% of our cohort and the likelihood of establishing a genetic diagnosis decreased as the age at onset of nephrotic syndrome increased. The most common mutated genes were ADCK4 (6.67%), NPHS1 (5.83%), WT1 (5.83%), and NPHS2 (3.33%), and the difference in the frequencies of ADCK4 and NPHS2 mutations between this study and a study on monogenic causes of SRNS in the largest international cohort of 1,783 different families was significant. A case of congenital nephrotic syndrome was attributed to a homozygous missense mutation in ADCK4, and a de novo missense mutation in TRPC6 was detected in a case of infantile nephrotic syndrome. Our results showed that, in the first and the largest multicenter cohort of Chinese pediatric SRNS reported to date, ADCK4 is the most common causative gene, whereas there is a low prevalence of NPHS2 mutations.

Insights into the Evolution of Hydroxyproline-Rich Glycoproteins from 1000 Plant Transcriptomes	PLANT PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							CELL-WALL PROTEIN; INTRINSICALLY DISORDERED REGIONS; MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; MOSS PHYSCOMITRELLA-PATENS; ARABINOGALACTAN-PROTEINS; CHLAMYDOMONAS-REINHARDTII; HIGH-THROUGHPUT; POSTTRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATIONS; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; RESEARCH CHALLENGES	The carbohydrate-rich cell walls of land plants and algae have been the focus of much interest given the value of cell wall-based products to our current and future economies. Hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs), a major group of wall glycoproteins, play important roles in plant growth and development, yet little is known about how they have evolved in parallel with the polysaccharide components of walls. We investigate the origins and evolution of the HRGP superfamily, which is commonly divided into three major multigene families: the arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs), extensins (EXTs), and proline-rich proteins. Using motif and amino acid bias, a newly developed bioinformatics pipeline, we identified HRGPs in sequences from the 1000 Plants transcriptome project (www.onekp.com). Our analyses provide new insights into the evolution of HRGPs across major evolutionary milestones, including the transition to land and the early radiation of angiosperms. Significantly, data mining reveals the origin of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored AGPs in green algae and a 3-to 4-fold increase in GPI-AGPs in liverworts and mosses. The first detection of cross-linking (CL)-EXTs is observed in bryophytes, which suggests that CL-EXTs arose though the juxtaposition of preexisting SPn EXT glycomotifs with refined Y-based motifs. We also detected the loss of CL-EXT in a few lineages, including the grass family (Poaceae), that have a cell wall composition distinct from other monocots and eudicots. A key challenge in HRGP research is tracking individual HRGPs throughout evolution. Using the 1000 Plants output, we were able to find putative orthologs of Arabidopsis pollen-specific GPI-AGPs in basal eudicots.

Novel mutations involving beta I-, beta IIA-, or beta IVB-tubulin isotypes with functional resemblance to beta III-tubulin in breast cancer	PROTOPLASMA			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	12th International Congress of Cell Biology (ICCB)	JUL 21-25, 2016	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC			beta III-tubulin; Breast cancer; Microtubule dynamics; Tubulin isotypes; Cancer-associated mutations; Anti-tumor drugs	CELL LUNG-CANCER; COLCHICINE BINDING; PROSTATE-CANCER; BOVINE BRAIN; MICROTUBULE DYNAMICS; OXIDATIVE STRESS; GTP HYDROLYSIS; EXPRESSION; PROTEIN; AGENTS	Tubulin is the target for very widely used anti-tumor drugs, including Vinca alkaloids, taxanes, and epothilones, which are an important component of chemotherapy in breast cancer and other malignancies. Paclitaxel and other tubulin-targeting drugs bind to the beta subunit of tubulin, which is a heterodimer of alpha and beta subunits. beta-Tubulin exists in the form of multiple isotypes, which are differentially expressed in normal and neoplastic cells and differ in their ability to bind to drugs. Among them, the beta III isotype is overexpressed in many aggressive and metastatic cancers and may serve as a prognostic marker in certain types of cancer. The underpinning mechanisms accounting for the overexpression of this isotype in cancer cells are unclear. To better understand the role of beta-tubulin isotypes in cancer, we analyzed over 1000 clones from 90 breast cancer patients, sequencing their beta-tubulin isotypes, in search of novel mutations. We have elucidated two putative emerging molecular subgroups of invasive breast cancer, each of which involve mutations in the beta I-, beta IIA-, or beta IVB isotypes of tubulin that increase their structural, and possibly functional, resemblance to the beta III isotype. A unifying feature of the first of the two subgroups is the mutation of the highly reactive C239 residue of beta I- or beta IVB-tubulin to L239, R239, Y239, or P239, culminating in probable conversion of these isotypes from ROS-sensitive to ROS-resistant species. In the second subgroup, beta I, beta IIA, and beta IVB have up to seven mutations to the corresponding residues in beta III-tubulin. Given that beta III-tubulin has emerged as a pro-survival factor, overexpression of this isotype may confer survival advantages to certain cancer cell types. In this mini-review, we bring attention to a novel mechanism by which cancer cells may undergo adaptive mutational changes involving alternate beta-tubulin isotypes to make them acquire some of the pro-survival properties of beta III-tubulin. These "hybrid" tubulins, combining the sequences and/or properties of two wild-type tubulins (beta III and either beta I, beta IIA, or beta IVB), are novel isotypes expressed solely in cancer cells and may contribute to the molecular understanding and stratification of invasive breast cancer and provide novel molecular targets for rational drug development.

It damages host plants through both phloem feeding and vectoring plant pathogens. Introductions of B. tabaci are difficult to quarantine and eradicate because of its high reproductive rates, broad host plant range, and insecticide resistance. A total of 791 Gb of raw DNA sequence from whole genome shotgun sequencing, and 13 BAC pooling libraries were generated by Illumina sequencing using different combinations of mate-pair and pair-end libraries. Assembly gave a final genome with a scaffold N50 of 437 kb, and a total length of 658 Mb. Annotation of repetitive elements and coding regions resulted in 265.0 Mb TEs (40.3%) and 20 786 protein-coding genes with putative gene family expansions, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on orthologs across 14 arthropod taxa suggested that MED/Q is clustered into a hemipteran clade containing A. pisum and is a sister lineage to a clade containing both R. prolixus and N. lugens. Genome completeness, as estimated using the CEGMA and Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs pipelines, reached 96% and 79%. These MED/Q genomic resources lay a foundation for future 'pan-genomic' comparisons of invasive vs. noninvasive, invasive vs. invasive, and native vs. exotic Bemisia, which, in return, will open up new avenues of investigation into whitefly biology, evolution, and management.

Induction of lipogenesis in white fat during cold exposure in mice: link to lean phenotype	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBESITY			English	Article							BROWN ADIPOSE-TISSUE; HORMONE-SENSITIVE LIPASE; DIET-INDUCED OBESITY; DE-NOVO LIPOGENESIS; TRIGLYCERIDE SYNTHESIS; ACID SYNTHESIS; UCP1-INDEPENDENT THERMOGENESIS; CALORIE RESTRICTION; ENERGY-EXPENDITURE; METABOLIC-ACTIVITY	BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Futile substrate cycling based on lipolytic release of fatty acids (FA) from intracellular triacylglycerols (TAG) and their re-esterification (TAG/FA cycling), as well as de novo FA synthesis (de novo lipogenesis (DNL)), represent the core energy-consuming biochemical activities of white adipose tissue (WAT). We aimed to characterize their roles in cold-induced thermogenesis and energy homeostasis. METHODS: Male obesity-resistant A/J and obesity-prone C57BL/6J mice maintained at 30 degrees C were exposed to 6 degrees C for 2 or 7 days. In epididymal WAT (eWAT), TAG synthesis and DNL were determined using in vivo H-2 incorporation from (H2O)-H-2 into tissue TAG and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Quantitative real-time-PCR and/or immunohistochemistry and western blotting were used to determine the expression of selected genes and proteins in WAT and liver. RESULTS: The mass of WAT depots declined during cold exposure (CE). Plasma levels of TAG and non-esterified FA were decreased by day 2 but tended to normalize by day 7 of CE. TAG synthesis (reflecting TAG/FA cycle activity) gradually increased during CE. DNL decreased by day 2 of CE but increased several fold over the control values by day 7. Expression of genes involved in lipolysis, glyceroneogenesis, FA re-esterification, FA oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis in eWAT was induced during CE. All these changes were more pronounced in obesity-resistant A/J than in B6 mice and occurred in the absence of uncoupling protein 1 in eWAT. Expression of markers of glyceroneogenesis in eWAT correlated negatively with hepatic FA synthesis by day 7 in both strains. Leptin and fibroblast growth factor 21 plasma levels were differentially affected by CE in the two mouse strains. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate integrated involvement of (i) TAG/FA cycling and DNL in WAT, and (ii) hepatic very-low-density lipoprotein-TAG synthesis in the control of blood lipid levels and provision of FA fuels for thermogenesis in cold. They suggest that lipogenesis in WAT contributes to a lean phenotype.

However, considering the increase in volume of gene catalogues and algorithms, an updated analysis would be expected to confirm previous discoveries and provide new knowledge. We therefore constructed new profiles after mapping the recent catalogue of reference genes in the human gut microbiome to reanalyze samples from T2DM cases and controls in the Chinese population. We identified different compositions between Chinese controls and T2DM patients at the species and genus levels, especially in the case of butyrate-producing bacteria, Haemophilus, and Lactobacillus. An effective metagenomic linkage group random forest model was built to differentiate controls from T2DM cases in different cohorts. Functional markers from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database were identified using new annotations. We also report 16 virulence factor markers and 22 antibiotic resistance markers associated with T2DM.

However up to now, very few studies have attempted to investigate the molecular responses of sesame to drought stress. In this experiment, two genotypes having contrasting responses to drought (tolerant and sensitive) were submitted to progressive drought followed by recovering stage at flowering stage. RNAs were isolated from roots of plants before drought stress, at 3-time points during progressive drought, after rewatering, and sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform. These RNA-Seq resources (BioSample IDs: SAMN06130606 and SAMN06130607) provided an opportunity to elucidate the molecular responses of sesame to drought and find out some candidate genes for drought tolerance improvement.

Until now, 2563 missing proteins (MPs, PE2-4) are still undetected even using the most sensitive approach of protein detection. Herein, we propose that enrichment of low-abundance proteins benefits MPs finding. ProteoMiner is an equalizing technique by reducing high-abundance proteins and enriching low abundance proteins in biological liquids. With triton X-100/TBS buffer extraction, ProteoMiner enrichment, and peptide fractionation, 20 MPs (at least two non-nested unique peptides with more than eight a.a. length) with 60 unique peptides were identified from four human tissues induding eight membrane/secreted proteins five nucleus proteins. Then confirmed with two non-nested unique peptides (>= 9 a.a.) identified by matching well with their chemically synthetic peptides in PRM assay. Hence, these results demonstrated ProteoMiner as a powerful means in discovery of MPs.

The phylogenetic relationships of the major vespid wasp lineages (i.e., subfamilies and tribes) have been investigated repeatedly by analyzing behavioral and morphological traits as well as nucleotide sequences of few selected genes with largely incongruent results. Here we reconstruct their phylogenetic relationships using a phylogenomic approach. We sequenced the transcriptomes of 24 vespid wasp and eight outgroup species and exploited the transcript sequences for design of probes for enriching 913 single-copy protein-coding genes to complement the transcriptome data with nucleotide sequence data from additional 25 ethanol-preserved vespid species. Results from phylogenetic analyses of the combined sequence data revealed the eusocial subfamily Stenogastrinae to be the sister group of all remaining Vespidae, while the subfamily Eumeninae turned out to be paraphyletic. Of the three currently recognized eumenine tribes, Odynerini is paraphyletic with respect to Eumenini, and Zethini is paraphyletic with respect to Polistinae and Vespinae. Our results are in conflict with the current tribal subdivision of Eumeninae and thus, we suggest granting subfamily rank to the two major clades of "Zethini": Raphiglossinae and Zethinae. Overall, our findings corroborate the hypothesis of two independent origins of eusociality in vespid wasps and suggest a single origin of using masticated and salivated plant material for building nests by Raphiglossinae, Zethinae, Polistinae, and Vespinae. The inferred phylogenetic relationships and the open access vespid wasp target DNA enrichment probes will provide a valuable tool for future comparative studies on species of the family Vespidae, including their genomes, life styles, evolution of sociality, and co-evolution with other organisms.

Yet, how spatial genome architecture is related to gene expression and cell fate remains unclear. We comprehensively mapped 3D chromatin organization during mouse neural differentiation in vitro and in vivo, generating the highest-resolution Hi-C maps available to date. We found that transcription is correlated with chromatin insulation and longrange interactions, but dCas9-mediated activation is insufficient for creating TAD boundaries de novo. Additionally, we discovered long-range contacts between gene bodies of exon-rich, active genes in all cell types. During neural differentiation, contacts between active TADs become less pronounced while inactive TADs interact more strongly. An extensive Polycomb network in stem cells is disrupted, while dynamic interactions between neural transcription factors appear in vivo. Finally, cell type-specific enhancer-promoter contacts are established concomitant to gene expression. This work shows that multiple factors influence the dynamics of chromatin interactions in development.

This study used Illumina high-throughput sequencing to investigate the broad-spectrum profiles of both ARGs and MGEs in activated sludge and anaerobically digested sludge from a full-scale wastewater treatment plant. A pipeline for identifying antibiotic resistance determinants was developed that consisted of four categories: gene transfer potential, ARG potential, ARGs pathway and ARGs phylogenetic origin. The metagenomic analysis showed that the activated sludge and the digested sludge exhibited different microbial communities and changes in the types and occurrence of ARGs and MGEs. In total, 42 ARGs subtypes were identified in the activated sludge, while 51 ARG subtypes were detected in the digested sludge. Additionally, MGEs including plasmids, transposons, integrons. (intil) and insertion sequences (e.g. ISSsp4, ISMsa21 and ISMba16) were abundant in the two sludge samples. The co-occurrence pattern between ARGs and microbial taxa revealed by network analysis indicated that some environmental bacteria (e.g. Clostridium and Nitrosomonas) might be potential hosts of multiple ARGs. The findings increase our understanding of WWTPs as hotspots of ARGs and MGEs, and contribute towards preventing their release into the downstream environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the composition and functional capacity of the gut microbiome in relation to cardiovascular diseases have not been systematically examined. Here, we perform a metagenome-wide association study on stools from 218 individuals with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACVD) and 187 healthy controls. The ACVD gut microbiome deviates from the healthy status by increased abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and Streptococcus spp. and, functionally, in the potential for metabolism or transport of several molecules important for cardiovascular health. Although drug treatment represents a confounding factor, ACVD status, and not current drug use, is the major distinguishing feature in this cohort. We identify common themes by comparison with gut microbiome data associated with other cardiometabolic diseases (obesity and type 2 diabetes), with liver cirrhosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Our data represent a comprehensive resource for further investigations on the role of the gut microbiome in promoting or preventing ACVD as well as other related diseases.

Here, we compared the gut microbial composition of 34 monozygotic twin pairs discordant for MS. While there were no major differences in the overall microbial profiles, we found a significant increase in some taxa such as Akkermansia in untreated MS twins. Furthermore, most notably, when transplanted to a transgenic mouse model of spontaneous brain autoimmunity, MS twin-derived microbiota induced a significantly higher incidence of autoimmunity than the healthy twin-derived microbiota. The microbial profiles of the colonized mice showed a high intraindividual and remarkable temporal stability with several differences, including Sutterella, an organism shown to induce a protective immunoregulatory profile in vitro. Immune cells from mouse recipients of MS-twin samples produced less IL-10 than immune cells from mice colonized with healthy-twin samples. IL-10 may have a regulatory role in spontaneous CNS autoimmunity, as neutralization of the cytokine in mice colonized with healthy-twin fecal samples increased disease incidence. These findings provide evidence that MS-derived microbiota contain factors that precipitate an MS-like autoimmune disease in a transgenic mouse model. They hence encourage the detailed search for protective and pathogenic microbial components in human MS.

Morrone] is a staple food for more than 90 million farmers in arid and semi-arid regions of sub-Saharan Africa, India and South Asia. We report the similar to 1.79 Gb draft whole genome sequence of reference genotype Tift 23D(2)B(1)-P1-P5, which contains an estimated 38,579 genes. We highlight the substantial enrichment for wax biosynthesis genes, which may contribute to heat and drought tolerance in this crop. We resequenced and analyzed 994 pearl millet lines, enabling insights into population structure, genetic diversity and domestication. We use these resequencing data to establish marker trait associations for genomic selection, to define heterotic pools, and to predict hybrid performance. We believe that these resources should empower researchers and breeders to improve this important staple crop.

Destruxin A, a mycotoxin of entomopathogenic fungus, Metarhizium anisopliae, has broad-spectrum insecticidal effects. However, the interaction mechanism of destruxin A with the immune system of P. xylostella at genomic level is still not well understood. Here, we identified 129 immunity-related genes, including pattern recognition receptors, signal modulators, few members of main immune pathways (Toll, Imd, and JAK/STAT), and immune effectors in P. xylostella in response to destruxin A at three different time courses (2 h, 4 h, and 6 h). It is worthy to mention that the immunity-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis exhibited 30, 78, and 72 up-regulated and 17, 13, and 6 down-regulated genes in P. xylostella after destruxin A injection at 2 h, 4 h, and 6 h, respectively, compared to control. Interestingly, our results revealed that the expression of antimicrobial peptides that play a vital role in insect immune system was up-regulated after the injection of destruxin A. Our findings provide a detailed information on immunity-related DEGs and reveal the potential of P. xylostella to limit the infection of fungal peptide destruxin A by increasing the activity of antimicrobial peptides.

CYP79 P450 monooxygenases in gymnosperms: CYP79A118 is associated with the formation of taxiphyllin in Taxus baccata	PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						Taxus baccata; Cytochrome P450 onooxygenase; CYP79; Aldoxime; Cyanogenic glycoside; Conifers; Taxiphyllin	CYANOGENIC GLUCOSIDE DHURRIN; BICOLOR L MOENCH; SORGHUM-BICOLOR; HYDROXYPHENYLACETALDEHYDE OXIME; CYTOCHROME-P450 ENZYMES; SUBSTRATE-SPECIFICITY; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; PLANT DEFENSE; BIOSYNTHESIS; EXPRESSION	Key message Conifers contain P450 enzymes from the CYP79 family that are involved in cyanogenic glycoside biosynthesis. Abstract Cyanogenic glycosides are secondary plant compounds that are widespread in the plant kingdom. Their biosynthesis starts with the conversion of aromatic or aliphatic amino acids into their respective aldoximes, catalysed by N-hydroxylating cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYP) of the CYP79 family. While CYP79s are well known in angiosperms, their occurrence in gymnosperms and other plant divisions containing cyanogenic glycoside-producing plants has not been reported so far. We screened the transcriptomes of 72 conifer species to identify putative CYP79 genes in this plant division. From the seven resulting full-length genes, CYP79A118 from European yew (Taxus baccata) was chosen for further characterization. Recombinant CYP79A118 produced in yeast was able to convert l-tyrosine, l-tryptophan, and l-phenylalanine into p-hydroxyphenylacetaldoxime, indole-3-acetaldoxime, and phenylacetaldoxime, respectively. However, the kinetic parameters of the enzyme and transient expression of CYP79A118 in Nicotiana benthamiana indicate that l-tyrosine is the preferred substrate in vivo. Consistent with these findings, taxiphyllin, which is derived from l-tyrosine, was the only cyanogenic glycoside found in the different organs of T. baccata. Taxiphyllin showed highest accumulation in leaves and twigs, moderate accumulation in roots, and only trace accumulation in seeds and the aril. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that CYP79A118 was expressed in plant organs rich in taxiphyllin. Our data show that CYP79s represent an ancient family of plant P450s that evolved prior to the separation of gymnosperms and angiosperms. CYP79A118 from T. baccata has typical CYP79 properties and its substrate specificity and spatial gene expression pattern suggest that the enzyme contributes to the formation of taxiphyllin in this plant species.

Among the three root-associated layers (i.e., rhizosphere, rhizoplane, and endorhiza), the rhizoplane is a key component serving a critical gating role that controls microbial entry into plant roots. The microbial communities colonizing the three layers are believed to be gradually enriched from the bulk soil inoculum. However, it is unknown how this enrichment process, particularly the rhizosphere to rhizoplane step, is affected by biotic stresses, such as disease. In this study, we address this question using the citrus root-associated microbiome as a model. Results: We identified the rhizosphere-to-rhizoplane-enriched taxonomic and functional properties of the citrus root-associated microbiome and determined how they were affected by Huanglongbing (HLB), a severe systemic disease caused by Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus, using metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approaches. Multiple rhizoplane-enriched genera were identified, with Bradyrhizobium and Burkholderia being the most dominant. Plant-derived carbon sources are an important driving force for the enrichment process. The enrichment of functional attributes, such as motility, chemotaxis, secretion systems, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis, demonstrated more active microbe-plant interactions on the rhizoplane than the rhizosphere. We observed that HLB impaired the rhizosphere-to-rhizoplane enrichment process of the citrus root-associated microbiome in three ways: (1) by decreasing the relative abundance of most rhizoplane-enriched genera; (2) by reducing the relative abundance and/or expression activity of the functional attributes involved in microbe-plant interactions; and (3) by recruiting more functional features involved in autotrophic life cycle adaptation, such as carbon fixation and nitrogen nitrification in the HLB rhizoplane microbiome. Finally, our data showed that inoculation of Burkholderia strains isolated from the healthy citrus root-associated microbiome could trigger the expression of genes involved in induced systemic resistance in inoculated plants. Conclusions: HLB causes decreased relative abundance and/or expression activity of rhizoplane-enriched taxonomic and functional properties, collectively resulting in impaired plant host-microbiome interactions. Manipulation of the citrus root-associated microbiome, for instance, by inoculating citrus roots with beneficial Burkholderia strains, has potential to promote plant health. Our results provide novel insights for understanding the contributions of the community enrichment process of the root-associated microbiome to the plant hosts.

Specifically, splicing factors play crucial roles in responses to environment and development cues; however, the underlying mechanisms are not well investigated in plants. Here, we report the parallel employment of short-read RNA sequencing, single molecule long-read sequencing and proteomic identification to unravel AS isoforms and previously unannotated proteins in response to abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. Combining the data from the two sequencing methods, approximately 83.4% of intron-containing genes were alternatively spliced. Two AS types, which are referred to as alternative first exon (AFE) and alternative last exon (ALE), were more abundant than intron retention (IR); however, by contrast to AS events detected under normal conditions, differentially expressed AS isoforms were more likely to be translated. ABA extensively affects the AS pattern, indicated by the increasing number of non-conventional splicing sites. This work also identified thousands of unannotated peptides and proteins by ATI based on mass spectrometry and a virtual peptide library deduced from both strands of coding regions within the Arabidopsis genome. The results enhance our understanding of AS and alternative translation mechanisms under normal conditions, and in response to ABA treatment.

Despite recent advances, many aspects of the biomineralization process and its evolutionary origin remain unknown. The pearl oyster Pinctada fucata martensii is a well-known master of biomineralization, but the molecular mechanisms that underlie its production of shells and pearls are not fully understood. Results: We sequenced the highly polymorphic genome of the pearl oyster and conducted multi-omic and biochemical studies to probe nacre formation. We identified a large set of novel proteins participating in matrix-framework formation, many in expanded families, including components similar to that found in vertebrate bones such as collagen-related VWA-containing proteins (VWAP), chondroitin sulfotransferases and regulatory elements. Conclusions: Considering that there are only collagen-based matrices in vertebrate bones and chitin-based matrices in most invertebrate skeletons, the presence of both chitin and elements of collagen-based matrices in nacre suggests that elements of chitin-and collagen-based matrices have deep roots and might be part of an ancient biomineralizing matrix. Our results expand the current shell matrix-framework model and provide new insights into the evolution of diverse biomineralization systems.

Limited information is available about the genetic control and genes associated with seed size and weight in sorghum. This study identified sorghum orthologs of genes with proven effects on seed size and weight in other plant species and searched for evidence of selection during domestication by utilizing resequencing data from a diversity panel. In total, 114 seed size candidate genes were identified in sorghum, 63 of which exhibited signals of purifying selection during domestication. A significant number of these genes also had domestication signatures in maize and rice, consistent with the parallel domestication of seed size in cereals. Seed size candidate genes that exhibited differentially high expression levels in seed were also found more likely to be under selection during domestication, supporting the hypothesis that modification to seed size during domestication preferentially targeted genes for intrinsic seed size rather than genes associated with physiological factors involved in the carbohydrate supply and transport. Our results provide improved understanding of the complex genetic control of seed size and weight and the impact of domestication on these genes.

Genome sequence of a diabetes-prone rodent reveals a mutation hotspot around the ParaHox gene cluster	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						desert rodent; type 2 diabetes; homeobox; Pdx1; gene conversion	RNA-SEQ DATA; PSAMMOMYS-OBESUS; PANCREAS; EXPRESSION; CONVERSION; PDX-1; IPF1; DIFFERENTIATION; DUODENUM; AGENESIS	The sand rat Psammomys obesus is a gerbil species native to deserts of North Africa and the Middle East, and is constrained in its ecology because high carbohydrate diets induce obesity and type II diabetes that, in extreme cases, can lead to pancreatic failure and death. We report the sequencing of the sand rat genome and discovery of an unusual, extensive, and mutationally biased GC-rich genomic domain. This highly divergent genomic region encompasses several functionally essential genes, and spans the ParaHox cluster which includes the insulin-regulating homeobox gene Pdx1. The sequence of sand rat Pdx1 has been grossly affected by GC-biased mutation, leading to the highest divergence observed for this gene across the Bilateria. In addition to genomic insights into restricted caloric intake in a desert species, the discovery of a localized chromosomal region subject to elevated mutation suggests that mutational heterogeneity within genomes could influence the course of evolution.

There is a dearth of understanding regarding the transcriptome landscape of LUAD without primary known driver mutations. In this study, LUAD samples without well-known driver mutations occurring in EGFR, KRAS, ALK, ROS1 or RET (quintuple-negative) were used for transcriptome study with a focus on long noncoding.RNAs (lncRNAs), alternative splicing and gene fusions. Materials and methods: 24 pairs of LUAD and adjacent normal samples and 13 tumor-only samples derived from 37 quintuple-negative patients were used. Differentially expressed lncRNA transcripts were detected by paired t-test and were validated by qPCR. Functions of IncRNAs were predicted by co-expressed mRNAs. Aberrant splicing events in LUAD were identified using MISO. In addition, gene fusions were screened by SOAPfuse. Results and conclusion: In total, 90 and 153 up- or down-regulated lncRNA transcripts were detected in LUAD samples in comparison with the adjacent normal samples. The most significantly differentially expressed lncRNA transcript was ENST00000598996.1 (FENDRR) down-regulated in LUAD. By lncRNA-mRNA co-expression analysis, functions of 14 lncRNAs were predicted. The predicted functions included vasculature development, immune response, cell cycle and respiratory gaseous exchange. Furthermore, six co-expressed pairs of IncRNAs and their nearby protein coding genes were identified as associated with lung development. This study also identified two highly recurrent (22 in 24) differential exon skipping events occurring in MYH14 and ESYT2 with exon including isoforms of both genes up-regulated in isoform percentage in LUAD samples. On the other hand, two out of 24 LUAD samples possessed the driver mutation exon 14 skipping of MET. The transcriptional alterations of LUAD samples without well-known driver mutations identified in the study can be used as references for future research. The translational values of these transcriptional changes are also worthy of further investigation.

Validation of combinatorial probe-anchor ligation-based sequencing as non-invasive prenatal test for trisomy at a central laboratory	ULTRASOUND IN OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY			English	Article						centralized mode; combinatorial probe-anchor ligation-based sequencer; cPAL; next generation sequencing; NIPT; non-invasive prenatal testing; prenatal screening	CELL-FREE DNA; ANEUPLOIDIES; DIAGNOSIS; PREGNANCIES; EXPERIENCE	Objective To evaluate the clinical validity of a new ultrahigh-throughput non-invasive prenatal test (NIPT) based on combinatorial probe-anchor ligation (cPAL) sequencing of cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) using centralized testing. Methods Maternal plasma samples were obtained from 10 594 singleton pregnancies in high-risk populations at 20 centers in China, including 8155 that were collected retrospectively and 2439 prospectively. Fetal outcome data and karyotyping results were documented as gold standard and were double blinded during NIPT. The clinical performance of the ultrahigh-throughput sequencing method, cPAL, for NIPT was validated by evaluating its sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) in detecting trisomies 21, 18 and 13 as the centralized testing mode in the reference laboratory. To ensure stable and reproducible performance of centralized cPAL-based NIPT in detecting trisomies, a series of quality-control systems, including sequencing of two sets of artificial samples, were employed and evaluated. Results Ten prospective cases were excluded from the study because of incomplete clinical data. Four prospective samples failed to generate a NIPT result due to assay failure, presenting a failure rate of 0.16% (4/2429). A total of 168 retrospective cases and 47 prospective cases had a positive NIPT result for trisomy, giving respective positive rates of 2.06% and 1.94%. Four false-positive and no false-positive cases were observed in the retrospective and prospective groups, respectively, resulting in PPV of 97.62% (95% CI, 94.02-99.35%) and 100% (95% CI, 92.45-100%), respectively. In the retrospective group, sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 100% (95% CI, 97.07-100%) and 99.98% (95% CI, 99.94100%) for trisomy 21, 100% (95% CI, 97.75-100%) and 99.98% (95% CI, 99.94-100%) for trisomy 18, and 100% (95% CI, 15.81-100%) and 100% (95% CI, 99.95-100%) for trisomy 13. In the prospective group, sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 100% (95% CI, 90.75-100%) and 100% (95% CI, 99.85-100%) for trisomy 21, 100% (95% CI, 63.06-100%) and 100% (95% CI, 99.85-100%) for trisomy 18, and 100% (95% CI, 2.50-100%) and 100% (95% CI, 99.85-100%) for trisomy 13. Conclusion In this multicenter study with a full quality-control system, NIPT by centralized cPAL-based testing showed high stability and performance comparable to those of previous validation studies in high-risk populations.

Methods: We have applied next-generation sequencing to detect deleterious mutations through all exons in 31 core HR genes. Paired whole blood and frozen tumor samples from 50 Chinese women diagnosed with epithelial ovarian carcinomas were tested to identify both germline and somatic variants. Results: Deleterious germline HR-mutations were identified in 36% of the ovarian cancer patients. Another 5 patients had only somatic mutations. BRCA2 was most frequently mutated. Three out of the 5 somatic mutations were in RAD genes and a wider distribution of other HR genes was involved in non-serous carcinomas. BRCA1/2-mutation carriers had favorable platinum sensitivity (relative risk, 1.57, p<0.05), resulting in a 100% remission probability and survival rate. In contrast, mutations in other HR genes predicted poor prognosis. However, multivariate analysis demonstrated that platinum sensitivity and optimal cytoreduction were the independent impact factors influencing survival (hazards ratio, 0.053) and relapse (hazards ratio, 0.247), respectively. Conclusion: Our results suggest that a more comprehensive profiling of HR defect than merely BRCA1/2 could help elucidate tumor heterogeneity and lead to better stratification of ovarian cancer patients for individualized clinical management.

The SL signalling mechanism is homologous to that of karrikins (KARs), smoke-derived compounds that stimulate seed germination. In angiosperms, the SL receptor is an a/beta-hydrolase known as DWARF14 (D14); its close homologue, KARRIKIN INSENSITIVE2 (KAI2), functions as a KAR receptor and likely recognizes an uncharacterized, endogenous signal ('KL'). Previous phylogenetic analyses have suggested that the KAI2 lineage is ancestral in land plants, and that canonical D14-type SL receptors only arose in seed plants; this is paradoxical, however, as non-vascular plants synthesize and respond to SLs. Results: We have used a combination of phylogenetic and structural approaches to re-assess the evolution of the D14/KAI2 family in land plants. We analysed 339 members of the D14/KAI2 family from land plants and charophyte algae. Our phylogenetic analyses show that the divergence between the eu-KAI2 lineage and the DDK (D14/DLK2/ KAI2) lineage that includes D14 occurred very early in land plant evolution. We show that eu-KAI2 proteins are highly conserved, and have unique features not found in DDK proteins. Conversely, we show that DDK proteins show considerable sequence and structural variation to each other, and lack clearly definable characteristics. We use homology modelling to show that the earliest members of the DDK lineage structurally resemble KAI2 and that SL receptors in non-seed plants likely do not have D14-like structure. We also show that certain groups of DDK proteins lack the otherwise conserved MORE AXILLARY GROWTH2 (MAX2) interface, and may thus function independently of MAX2, which we show is highly conserved throughout land plant evolution. Conclusions: Our results suggest that D14-like structure is not required for SL perception, and that SL perception has relatively relaxed structural requirements compared to KAI2-mediated signalling. We suggest that SL perception gradually evolved by neo-functionalization within the DDK lineage, and that the transition from KAI2-like to D14-like protein may have been driven by interactions with protein partners, rather than being required for SL perception per se.

The gut microbiota closely interacts with the host immune system, but its functional impact in CD is unclear. Except for studies on a small number of CD patients, analyses of the gut microbiota in CD have used 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing. Here we employed metagenomic shotgun sequencing to provide a detailed characterization of the compositional and functional features of the CD microbiota, comprising also unannotated bacteria, and investigated its modulation by exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN). Results: Based on signature taxa, CD microbiotas clustered into two distinct metacommunities indicating individual variability in CD microbiome structure. Metacommunity-specific functional shifts in CD showed enrichment in producers of the pro-inflammatory hexa-acylated lipopolysaccharide variant and a reduction in the potential to synthesize short chain fatty acids. Disruption of ecological networks was evident in CD, coupled with reduction in growth rates of many bacterial species. Short-term EEN elicited limited impact on the overall composition of the CD microbiota, although functional changes occurred following treatment. Conclusions: The microbiotas in CD patients can be stratified into two distinct metacommunities with the most severely perturbed metacommunity exhibiting functional potentials that deviate markedly from that of the healthy individuals with possible implication in relation to CD pathogenesis.

Molecular adaptations to high-altitude living have been detected in the genomes of Tibetans, their domesticated animals and a few wild species, but the contribution of transcriptional variation to altitudinal adaptation remains to be determined. Here we studied a top QTP predator, the saker falcon, and analysed how the transcriptome has become modified to cope with the stresses of hypoxia and hypothermia. Using a hierarchical design to study saker populations inhabiting grassland, steppe/desert and highland across Eurasia, we found that the QTP population is already distinct despite having colonized the Plateau <2000years ago. Selection signals are limited at the cDNA level, but of only seventeen genes identified, three function in hypoxia and four in immune response. Our results show a significant role for RNA transcription: 50% of upregulated transcription factors were related to hypoxia responses, differentiated modules were significantly enriched for oxygen transport, and importantly, divergent EPAS1 functional variants with a refined co-expression network were identified. Conservative gene expression and relaxed immune gene variation may further reflect adaptation to hypothermia. Our results exemplify synergistic responses between DNA polymorphism and RNA expression diversity in coping with common stresses, underpinning the successful rapid colonization of a top predator onto the QTP. Importantly, molecular mechanisms underpinning highland adaptation involve relatively few genes, but are nonetheless more complex than previously thought and involve fine-tuned transcriptional responses and genomic adaptation.

Targeted sequencing of maternal plasma for haplotype-based non-invasive prenatal testing of spinal muscular atrophy	ULTRASOUND IN OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY			English	Article						haplotype; non-invasive prenatal test; spinal muscular atrophy	DIAGNOSIS	Five pregnant women with a child affected by spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) were recruited between November 2014 and March 2015. Deletion of exons 7 and/or 8 in the SMN1 gene were identified by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), the current standard diagnostic test for SMA. Parental and fetal haplotypes of the SMN1 gene were determined in each family from haplotype-based non-invasive testing of blood samples and maternal plasma, respectively. Fetal haplotype was compared with the results of MLPA of fetal DNA obtained from amniotic fluid or chorionic villi. Parental haplotypes were constructed successfully in the five families. Assisted by the information on parental haplotype, non-invasive testing of maternal plasma identified one fetus with homozygous deletion of exons 7 and 8, two fetuses with heterozygous deletion of exons 7 and 8 and two normal fetuses. These results were consistent with the diagnosis by MLPA. Copyright (C) 2016 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.	[Chen, M.; Lai, Z.

In this study, using metagenomic sequencing, we identified a new enterovirus 96 strain (EV-96-SZ/GD/CHN/2014) as the sole pathogen causing hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). A genomic comparison showed that EV-96-SZ/GD/CHN/2014 is most similar to the EV-96-05517 strain (85% identity), which has also been detected in Guangdong Province. This is the first time that metagenomic sequencing has been used to identify an EV-96 strain shown to be associated with HFMD.

Although studies have revealed the risk factors and pathophysiology theories of AMS, the molecular mechanisms of it do not comprehensively illustrate. Here, we used a system-level methodology, RNA sequencing, to explore the molecular mechanisms of AMS at genome-wide level in 10 individuals. After exposure to high altitude, a total of 1,164 and 1,322 differentially expressed transcripts were identified in AMS and non-AMS groups, respectively. Among them, only 328 common transcripts presented between the two groups. Immune and inflammatory responses were overrepresented in participants with AMS, but not in non-AMS individuals. Anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 and inflammation cytokines IF17F and CCL8 exhibited significantly different genetic connectivity in AMS compared to that of non-AMS individuals based on network analysis. IL10 was downregulated and both IF17F and CCL8 were upregulated in AMS individuals. Moreover, the serum concentration of IL10 significantly decreased in AMS patients after exposure to high altitude (p = 0.001) in another population (n = 22). There was a large negative correlation between the changes in IL10 concentration, r(22) = -0.52, p = 0.013, and Lake Louise Score. Taken together, our analysis provides unprecedented characterization of AMS transcriptome and identifies that genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses were disturbed in AMS individuals by high-altitude exposure. The reduction of IL10 after exposure to high altitude was associated with AMS.

Byssus, secreted by the foot gland, has been proved to bind heavy metals effectively. In this study, using the RNA sequencing technology, we performed comparative transcriptomic analysis on the mussel feet with or without inducing by cadmium (Cd). Our current work is aiming at providing insights into the molecular mechanisms of byssus binding to heavy metal ions. The transcriptome sequencing generated a total of 26.13-Gb raw data. After a careful assembly of clean data, we obtained a primary set of 105,127 unigenes, in which 32,268 unigenes were annotated. Based on the expression profiles, we identified 9,048 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between Cd treatment (50 or 100 mu g/L) at 48 h and the control, suggesting an extensive transcriptome response of the mussels during the Cd stimulation. Moreover, we observed that the expression levels of 54 byssus protein coding genes increased significantly after the 48-h Cd stimulation. In addition, 16 critical byssus protein coding genes were picked for profiling by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Finally, we reached a primary conclusion that high content of tyrosine (Tyr), cysteine (Cys), histidine (His) residues or the special motif plays an important role in the accumulation of heavy metals in byssus. We also proposed an interesting model for the confirmed byssal Cd accumulation, in which biosynthesis of byssus proteins may play simultaneously critical roles since their transcription levels were significantly elevated.

In the past few years, increasing numbers of studies have been published on the potential pharmacological activities of R. crenulata, strengthening our understanding into its putitive active ingredient composition, pharmacological activity, and mechanism of action. These findings also provide strong evidence supporting the important medicinal and economical value of R. crenulata. Consequently, some Rhodiola species are becoming endangered because of overexploitation and environmental destruction. However, little is known about the genetic and genomic information of any Rhodiola species. Here we report the first draft assembly of the R. crenulata genome, which was 344.5 Mb (25.7 Mb Ns), accounting for 82% of the estimated genome size, with a scaffold N50 length of 144.7 kb and a contig N50 length of 25.4 kb. The R. crenulata genome is not only highly heterozygous but also highly repetitive, with ratios of 1.12% and 66.15%, respectively, based on the k-mer analysis. Furthermore, 226.6 Mb of transposable elements were detected, of which 77.03% were long terminal repeats. In total, 31 517 protein-coding genes were identified, capturing 86.72% of expected plant genes in BUSCO. Additionally, 79.73% of protein-coding genes were functionally annotated. R. crenulata is an important medicinal plant and also a potentially interesting model species for studying the adaptability of Rhodiola species to extreme environments. The genomic sequences of R. crenulata will be useful for understanding the evolutionary mechanism of the stress resistance gene and the biosynthesis pathways of the different medicinal ingredients, for example, salidroside in R. crenulata.

The chemical and biological diversity of marine toxins is immeasurable and as such an extraordinary resource for the discovery of new drugs. With the rapid development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), it has been much easier and faster to identify more toxins and predict their functions with bioinformatics pipelines, which pave the way for novel drug developments. Here we provide an overview of related bioinformatics pipelines that have been supported by a combination of transcriptomics and proteomics for identification and function prediction of novel marine toxins.

Using DNA nanoball and combinational probe anchor synthesis developed from Complete GenomicsTM sequencing technologies, it generates short reads at a large scale. Findings: Here, we present the first human whole-genome sequencing dataset of BGISEQ-500. The dataset was generated by sequencing the widely used cell line HG001 (NA12878) in two sequencing runs of paired-end 50 bp (PE50) and two sequencing runs of paired-end 100 bp (PE100). We also include examples of the raw images from the sequencer for reference. Finally, we identified variations using this dataset, estimated the accuracy of the variations, and compared to that of the variations identified from similar amounts of publicly available HiSeq2500 data. Conclusions: We found similar single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection accuracy for the BGISEQ-500 PE100 data (false positive rate [ FPR] = 0.00020%, sensitivity = 96.20%) compared to the PE150 HiSeq2500 data (FPR = 0.00017%, sensitivity = 96.60%) better SNP detection accuracy than the PE50 data (FPR = 0.0006%, sensitivity = 94.15%). But for insertions and deletions (indels), we found lower accuracy for BGISEQ-500 data (FPR = 0.00069% and 0.00067% for PE100 and PE50 respectively, sensitivity = 88.52% and 70.93%) than the HiSeq2500 data (FPR = 0.00032%, sensitivity = 96.28%). Our dataset can serve as the reference dataset, providing basic information not just for future development, but also for all research and applications based on the new sequencing platform.

However, the response of gut microbiota to acarbose is important, as the microbiota may have a critical role in the development of metabolic diseases, and acarbose is metabolized exclusively within the gastrointestinal tract. We explored the changes in the proportion and diversity of gut microbiota before and after treatment with acarbose in patients with prediabetes. Methods: We designed a randomized, double-blind, controlled crossover trial in which 52 Chinese patients with prediabetes by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with a BMI of 18-35 kg/m(2) were randomly allocated to treatment with acarbose or placebo. Gut microbiota characterizations were determined with16SrDNA-basedhigh-throughput sequencing. Results: Of the 52 participants who entered the study, 40 (76.9%) completed the protocol. On the basis of the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) profiles, a total of 107 OTUs were significantly altered after acarbose treatment, with 76 (71%) assigned to the order of Clostridiales. Ruminococcaceae (15 OTUs) and Lachnospiraceae (22 OTUs) decreased in response to acarbose, and 48 OTUs increased by 12.8-fold, including Lactobacillaceae (8 of 9 belonging to Lactobacillus), Ruminococcaceae (6 of 11 belonging to Faecalibacterium), and Veillonellaceae (8 of 15 belonging to Dialister). At genera level, five flourished after treatment with acarbose, including Lactobacillus and Dialister, while Butyricicoccus, Phascolarctobacterium, and Ruminococcus were inhibited. Conclusion: This study suggests that the benefits of acarbose for T2DM may correlate with the selective modulation of the gut microbiota.

This study applied RNA-sequencing to examine functional effects of the PIGA mutation in human granulocytes. CXCR2 expression was increased in GPI-AP compared to GPI-AP(+) granulocytes. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor, a CXCR2 agonist, was significantly higher in plasma of PNH patients. Nuclear factor kB phosphorylation was upregulated in GPI-AP-compared with GPI-AP(+) granulocytes. Our data suggest novel mechanisms in PNH, not obviously predicted by decreased production of the GPI moiety.

Clinical application of whole-genome low-coverage next-generation sequencing to detect and characterize balanced chromosomal translocations	CLINICAL GENETICS			English	Article						balanced chromosomal translocation; chromosomal microarray; fluorescence in situ hybridization; high-throughput nucleotide sequencing; karyotyping; prenatal diagnosis	MENTAL-RETARDATION; REARRANGEMENTS; BREAKPOINTS; MUTATION; CARRIERS; RISK	Individuals carrying balanced translocations have a high risk of birth defects, recurrent spontaneous abortions and infertility. Thus, the detection and characterization of balanced translocations is important to reveal the genetic background of the carriers and to provide proper genetic counseling. Next-generation sequencing (NGS), which has great advantages over other methods such as karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), has been used to detect disease-associated breakpoints. Herein, to evaluate the application of this technology to detect balanced translocations in the clinic, we performed a parental study for prenatal cases with unbalanced translocations. Eight candidate families with potential balanced translocations were investigated using two strategies in parallel, low-coverage whole-genome sequencing (WGS) followed-up by Sanger sequencing and G-banding karyotype coupled with FISH. G-banding analysis revealed three balanced translocations, and FISH detected two cryptic submicroscopic balanced translocations. Consistently, WGS detected five balanced translocations and mapped all the breakpoints by Sanger sequencing. Analysis of the breakpoints revealed that six genes were disrupted in the four apparently healthy carriers. In summary, our result suggested low-coverage WGS can detect balanced translocations reliably and can map breakpoints precisely compared with conventional procedures. WGS may replace cytogenetic methods in the diagnosis of balanced translocation carriers in the clinic.

DNA methylation changes at infertility genes in newborn twins conceived by in vitro fertilisation	GENOME MEDICINE			English	Article						In vitro fertilisation (IVF); Epigenomics; DNA methylation; MeDIP-seq	INTRACYTOPLASMIC SPERM INJECTION; EPIGENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; ASSISTED REPRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY; SINGLE-NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS; BECKWITH-WIEDEMANN-SYNDROME; GENOME-WIDE; METASTABLE EPIALLELES; IMPRINTING DEFECTS; EPIGENETIC TWINS; PREGNANCIES	Background: The association of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and DNA methylation has been studied predominantly at regulatory regions of imprinted genes and at just thousands of the similar to 28 million CpG sites in the human genome. Methods: We investigated the links between IVF and DNA methylation patterns in whole cord blood cells (n = 98) and cord blood mononuclear cells (n = 82) from newborn twins using genome-wide methylated DNA immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing. Results: At a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%, we identified one significant whole blood DNA methylation change linked to conception via IVF, which was located similar to 3 kb upstream of TNP1, a gene previously linked to male infertility. The 46 most strongly associated signals ( FDR of 25%) included a second region in a gene also previously linked to infertility, C9orf3, suggesting that our findings may in part capture the effect of parental subfertility. Using twin modelling, we observed that individual-specific environmental factors appear to be the main overall contributors of methylation variability at the FDR 25% IVF-associated differentially methylated regions, although evidence for methylation heritability was also obtained at several of these regions. We replicated previous findings of differential methylation associated with IVF at the H19/IGF2 region in cord blood mononuclear cells, and we validated the signal at C9orf3 in monozygotic twins. We also explored the impact of intracytoplasmic sperm injection on the FDR 25% signals for potential effects specific to male or female infertility factors. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive study of DNA methylation profiles at birth and IVF conception to date, and our results show evidence for epigenetic modifications that may in part reflect parental subfertility.

For example, its forehead protrudes forward like a rhinoceros horn. Here, we first reported the complete mitochondrial genome of this semi-caved teleost. The whole mitochondria! genome was 16 588 bp, and composed of 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNAs, 2 ribosomal RNAs, and a 933 bp control region. A phylogenetic tree with the complete mitochondrial genome sequences of S. rhinocerous together with 10 other affinis species was constructed. The newly achieved mitochondrial genome sequence seem to be useful for addressing taxonomic issues and studying related evolution events, which would contribute to enrich the fish mitochondria! genome resource and promote the biological research.

Single-cell RNA sequencing data of 37 Hela-S3 cells were analysed. On average, 511 lincRNAs were expressed in each cell. Comparing the expression difference of the lincRNAs and protein-coding genes, we found that lincRNAs expression displayed more cell specificity than that of protein-coding genes (t-test, P < 2.2E-16). In co-expression network analysis, we identified seven modules and one of them was enriched in pathways of mitotic, packaging of telomere ends, and chromosome maintenance. incRNAs are specifically expressed and form a network to perform function at single cell level. Their expression was more specific than that of protein-coding genes.

(Cornaceae) - Insights from transcriptome sequences	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NUCLEOTIDE SUBSTITUTION; FLOWERING PLANTS; ANGIOSPERM DIVERSIFICATION; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; FLORAL TRANSCRIPTOME; ABSOLUTE RATES; GENES; POLYPLOIDY; ARABIDOPSIS; INFERENCE	The pattern and rate of genome evolution have profound consequences in organismal evolution. Whole-genome duplication (WGD), or polyploidy, has been recognized as an important evolutionary mechanism of plant diversification. However, in non-model plants the molecular signals of genome duplications have remained largely unexplored. High-throughput transcriptome data from next-generation sequencing have set the stage for novel investigations of genome evolution using new bioinformatic and methodological tools in a phylogenetic framework. Here we compare ten de novo-assembled transcriptomes representing the major lineages of the angiosperm genus Cornus (dogwood) and relevant outgroups using a customized pipeline for analyses. Using three distinct approaches, molecular dating of orthologous genes, analyses of the distribution of synonymous substitutions between paralogous genes, and examination of substitution rates through time, we detected a shared WGD event in the late Cretaceous across all taxa sampled. The inferred doubling event coincides temporally with the paleoclimatic changes associated with the initial divergence of the genus into three major lineages. Analyses also showed an acceleration of rates of molecular evolution after WGD. The highest rates of molecular evolution were observed in the transcriptome of the herbaceous lineage, C. canadensis, a species commonly found at higher latitudes, including the Arctic. Our study demonstrates the value of transcriptome data for understanding genome evolution in closely related species. The results suggest dramatic increase in sea surface temperature in the late Cretaceous may have contributed to the evolution and diversification of flowering plants.

A lot of effort has been devoted to improve the identification accuracy and sensitivity for peptides/proteins, such as developing advanced algorithms and expanding protein databases. Results: Herein, we described a new strategy for enhancing the sensitivity of protein/peptide identification through combination of mRNA and peptide abundance in Percolator. In our strategy, a new workflow for peptide identification is established on the basis of the abundance of transcripts and potential novel transcripts derived from RNA-Seq and abundance of peptides towards the same life species. We demonstrate the utility of this strategy by two MS/MS datasets and the results indicate that about 5% similar to 8% improvement of peptide identification can be achieved with 1% FDR in peptide level by integrating the peptide abundance, the transcript abundance and potential novel transcripts from RNA-Seq data. Meanwhile, 181 and 154 novel peptides were identified in the two datasets, respectively. Conclusions: We have demonstrated that this strategy could enable improvement of peptide/protein identification and discovery of novel peptides, as compared with the traditional search methods.

Genomic Variant in IL-37 Confers A Significant Risk of Coronary Artery Disease	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							CHINESE HAN POPULATION; PARTICULARLY ANKYLOSING-SPONDYLITIS; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; WIDE ASSOCIATION; ISCHEMIC-STROKE; ANTIINFLAMMATORY CYTOKINE; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; SUSCEPTIBILITY LOCUS; PSORIATIC-ARTHRITIS; GENE	The interleukin 1 family plays an important role in the immune and inflammatory responses. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a chronic inflammatory disease. However, the genetic association between IL-37, the seventh member of the IL-1 family, and CAD is unknown. Here we show that a single nucleotide polymorphism in the IL-37 gene (rs3811047) confers a significant risk of CAD. We have performed an association analysis between rs3811047 and CAD in two independent populations with 2,501 patients and 3,116 controls from China. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis has been performed to determine if the IL-37 expression level is influenced by rs3811047. We show that the minor allele A of rs3811047 is significantly associated with CAD in two independent populations under a recessive model (P-adj = 5.51 x 10(-3)/ OR = 1.56 in the GeneID Northernern population and P-adj = 1.23 x 10(-3)/OR = 1.45 in the GeneID Central population). The association became more significant in the combined population (P-adj = 9.70 x 10(-6)/ OR = 1.47). Moreover, the association remains significant in a CAD case control population matched for age and sex. Allele A of rs3811047 shows significant association with a decreased mRNA expression level of IL-37 (n = 168, P = 3.78 x 10(-4)). These data suggest that IL37 is a new susceptibility gene for CAD, which provides a potential target for the prevention and treatment of CAD.

Current status and future direction of cryopreservation of camelid embryos	THERIOGENOLOGY			English	Review						Camelid; Embryo; Cryopreservation	ICE-SEEDING TEMPERATURE; CLEAVAGE-STAGE EMBRYOS; HATCHED BLASTOCYSTS; TREATED RECIPIENTS; EQUINE EMBRYOS; SHEEP EMBRYOS; HUMAN OOCYTES; IN-VITRO; VITRIFICATION; DROMEDARIUS	Over the past 3 decades, and similar to the horse industry, fresh embryo transfer has been widely practiced on large commercial scales in different camelid species, especially the dromedary camel and alpaca. However, the inability to cryopreserve embryos significantly reduces its broader application, and as such limits the capacity to utilize elite genetic resources internationally. In addition, cryopreservation of the semen of camelids is also difficult, suggesting an extreme sensitivity of the germplasm to cooling and freezing. As a result, genetic resources of camelids must continue to be maintained as living collections of animals. Due to concerns over disease outbreaks such as that of the highly pathogenic Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in the Middle East and Asia, there is an urgent need to establish an effective gene banking system for camelid species, especially the camel. The current review compares and summarizes recent progress in the field of camelid embryo cryopreservation, identifying four possible reasons for the slow development of an effective protocol and describing eight future directions to improve the current protocols. At the same time, the results of a recent dromedary camel embryo transfer study which produced a high morphologic integrity and survival rate of Open Pulled Straw-vitrified embryos are also discussed.

Relationships between the T-cell receptors (TCR) borne by T cells within tumors, in the surrounding tissues, and in draining lymph nodes are largely unexplored in human breast cancer. Consequently, information about the relative extent of possible T-cell exchange between these tissues is also lacking. Here, we have analyzed the TCR repertoire of T cells using multiplex PCR and high-throughput sequencing of the TCR beta chain in the tissues of tumor, adjacent nontumor, and axillary lymph nodes of breast cancer patients. T-cell repertoire diversity in tumors was lower than in lymph nodes, but higher than in nontumor tissue, with a preferential use of variable and joining genes. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that most of the T cells in tumors derive from the lymph node, followed by their expansion in tumor tissue. Positive nodes appeared to enhance T-cell infiltration into tumors and T-cell clonal expansion in lymph nodes. Additionally, the similarity in TCR repertoire between tumor and nontumor tissue was significantly higher in luminal-like, rather than basal-like, breast cancer. Our study elucidated the high heterogeneity of the TCR repertoire and provides potential for future improvements in immune-related diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis for breast cancer patients.

Through genetic linkage analysis and exome sequencing, C14orf93 (RTFC), PYGL, and BMP4 were identified as susceptibility gene candidates in a FNMTC family. By examining the expression and the oncogenic functions of these candidate genes, PYGL and BMP4 were excluded. We further characterized the functions of the uncharacterized gene RTFC in thyroid cancer. RTFC promotes thyroid cancer cell survival under starving conditions, and thyroid cancer cell migration.

Somatically acquired SV may regulate the expression of tumor-related genes and result in cell proliferation and uncontrolled growth, eventually inducing tumor formation. Virus integration with host genome sequence is a type of SV that causes the related gene instability and normal cells to transform into tumor cells. Cancer SVs and viral integration sites must be discovered in a genome-wide scale for clarifying the mechanism of tumor occurrence and development. Results: In this paper, we propose a new tool called seeksv to detect somatic SVs and viral integration events. Seeksv simultaneously uses split read signal, discordant paired-end read signal, read depth signal and the fragment with two ends unmapped. Seeksv can detect DEL, insertion, inversion and inter-chromosome transfer at single-nucleotide resolution. Different types of sequencing data, such as single-end sequencing data or paired-end sequencing data can accommodate to detect SV. Seeksv develops a rescue model for SV with breakpoints located in sequence homology regions. Results on simulated and real data from the 1000 Genomes Project and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma samples show that seeksv has higher efficiency and precision compared with other similar software in detecting SVs. For the discovery of hepatitis B virus integration sites from probe capture data, the verified experiments show that more than 90% viral integration sequences detected by seeksv are true.

Dendrobium officinale is a special orchid species that can grow without seed vernalization. Because the whole-genome sequence of D. officinale is publicly available, this species is poised to become a convenient research model for the evolutionary, developmental, and genetic studies of Orchidaceae. Despite these advantages, the methods of genetic manipulation are poorly developed in D. officinale. In this study, based on the previously developed Agrobacterium-mediated gene transformation system, we identified several highly efficient promoters for exogenous gene expression and successfully applied the CRISPR/Cas9 system for editing endogenous genes in the genome of D. officinale. These two basic techniques contribute to the genetic manipulation toolbox of Orchidaceae. The pCambia-1301-35SN vector containing the CaMV 35S promoter and the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) and Superfolder green fluorescence protein (SG) as reporter genes were introduced into the plant tissues by the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system. Fluorescence emission from the transformed plants confirmed the successful transcription and translation of SG genes into functional proteins. We compared the GUS activity under different promoters including four commonly used promoters (MtHP, CVMV, MMV and PCISV) with CaMV 35S promoter and found that MMV, CVMV, and PCISV were as effective as the 35S promoter. Furthermore, we applied the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing system successfully in D. officinale. By selecting five target genes (C3H, C4H, 4CL, CCR, and IRX) in the lignocellulose biosynthesis pathway, we showed that, for a given target, this system can generate edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) at a rate of 10 to 100%. These results showed that our two genetic manipulation tools can efficiently express exogenous genes and edit endogenous genes in D. officinale. These efficient research tools will not only help create novel a officinale varieties, but will also facilitate the molecular genetic investigation of orchid biology.

Although differentiation therapy has been proposed as a potential approach to treat GBM, the mechanisms of induced differentiation remain poorly defined. Here, we established an induced differentiation model of GBM using cAMP activators that specifically directed GBM differentiation into astroglia. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed that oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial biogenesis are involved in induced differentiation of GBM. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP) reverses the Warburg effect, as evidenced by increased oxygen consumption and reduced lactate production. Mitochondrial biogenesis induced by activation of the CREB-PGC1 alpha pathway triggers metabolic shift and differentiation. Blocking mitochondrial biogenesis using mdivi1 or by silencing PGC1 alpha abrogates differentiation; conversely, overexpression of PGC1 alpha elicits differentiation. In GBM xenograft models and patient-derived GBM samples, cAMP activators also induce tumor growth inhibition and differentiation. Our data show that mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolic switch to oxidative phosphorylation drive the differentiation of tumor cells.

Because of its high reproductive potential, dispersal capability and transmission of plant viral diseases, S. furcifera causes considerable damage to rice grain production and has great economical and agricultural impacts. Comprehensive studies into ecological aspects and virus-host interactions of S. furcifera have been limited because of the lack of a well-assembled genome sequence. Findings: A total of 241.3 Gb of raw reads from the whole genome of S. furcifera were generated by Illumina sequencing using different combinations of mate-pair and paired-end libraries from 17 insert libraries ranging between 180 bp and 40 kbp. The final genome assembly (0.72 Gb), with average N50 contig size of 70.7 kb and scaffold N50 of 1.18 Mb, covers 98.6 % of the estimated genome size of S. furcifera. Genome annotation, assisted by eight different developmental stages (embryos, 1(st)-5(th) instar nymphs, 5-day-old adults and 10-day-old adults), generated 21 254 protein-coding genes, which captured 99.59 % (247/248) of core CEGMA genes and 91.7 % (2453/2675) of BUSCO genes. Conclusions: We report the first assembled and annotated whole genome sequence and transcriptome of S. furcifera. The assembled draft genome of S. furcifera will be a valuable resource for ecological and virus-host interaction studies of this pest.

In this study, we report a patient with suspected Leigh syndrome presenting with seizures, ptosis, scoliosis, dystonia, symmetrical putaminal abnormalities and a lactate peak on brain MRS, but showing normal MRC enzymology in muscle and liver, thereby complicating the diagnosis. Whole exome sequencing uncovered compound heterozygous mutations in NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) flavoprotein 1 gene (NDUFV1), c.1162+4A>C (NM_007103.3), resulting in skipping of exon 8, and c.640G>A, causing the amino acid substitution p.Glu214Lys, both of which have previously been reported in a patient with complex I deficiency. Patient fibroblasts showed a significant reduction in NDUFV1 protein expression, decreased complex CI and complex IV assembly and consequential reductions in the enzymatic activities of both complexes by 38% and 67%, respectively. The pathogenic effect of these variations was further confirmed by immunoblot analysis of subunits for MRC enzyme complexes in patient muscle, liver and fibroblast where we observed 90%, 60% and 95% reduction in complex CI, respectively. Together these studies highlight the importance of a comprehensive, multipronged approach to the laboratory evaluation of patients with suspected Leigh syndrome.

Congenital cataract is the cloudiness of the eye's natural lens and is a primary cause of congenital vision loss. It accounts for almost 10% of childhood vision loss worldwide. Methods. A four generation Chinese family having seven affected individuals was recruited for the current study. Exome sequencing was performed to identify the genetic cause of congenital cataract. Results. Analysis of data identified a novel frameshift mutation, c.608delC (p.A203fs), in the PITX3 gene. This mutation was only observed in the affected individuals while the unaffected members of the family as well as 100 ethnically matched normal controls did not contain this deletion. Conclusion. These findings suggest that p.A203fs is the cause of cataracts in the recruited family. This information would be further helpful in the genetic diagnosis of cataract and in the genetic counseling of similar patients.

However, it is not clear to what extent oral administration of probiotics can affect gut microbiota composition, thus inhibiting food allergy development. Using ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized murine model, it was demonstrated that probiotics ameliorated allergic symptoms, including reducing OVA specificIgE, and - IgG1 levels in the serum, Th2 cytokines release in spleen, and occurrence of diarrhea. Moreover, 16S rRNA analysis showed that the probiotics-mediated protection was conferred by an enrichment of Coprococcus and Rikenella. The present study supports the theory that probiotics can treat food allergy by modulating specific genera of the gut microbiota.

Enhanced Detection of Cancer Biomarkers in Blood-Borne Extracellular Vesicles Using Nanodroplets and Focused Ultrasound	CANCER RESEARCH			English	Article							PROSTATE-CANCER; MESSENGER-RNA; PHASE-SHIFT; IN-VITRO; MODEL; CELLS; CAVITATION; METASTASES; EXOSOMES; THERAPY	The feasibility of personalized medicine approaches will be greatly improved by the development of noninvasive methods to interrogate tumor biology. Extracellular vesicles shed by solid tumors into the bloodstream have been under recent investigation as a source of tumor-derived biomarkers such as proteins and nucleic acids. We report here an approach using submicrometer perfluorobutane nanodroplets and focused ultrasound to enhance the release of extracellular vesicles from specific locations in tumors into the blood. The released extracellular vesicles were enumerated and characterized using micro flow cytometry. Only in the presence of nanodroplets could ultrasound release appreciable levels of tumor-derived vesicles into the blood. Sonication of HT1080-GFP tumors did not increase the number of circulating tumor cells or the metastatic burden in the tumor-bearing embryos. A variety of biological molecules were successfully detected tumor-derived extracellular vesicles, including cancer-associated proteins, mRNAs, and miRNAs. Sonication of xenograft HT1080 fibrosarcoma tumors released extracellular vesicles that contained detectable RAC1 mRNA with the highly tumorigenic N92I mutation known to exist in HT1080 cells. Deep sequencing serum samples of embryos with sonicated tumors allowed the identification of an additional 13 known heterozygous mutations in HT1080 cells. Applying ultrasound to HT1080 tumors increased tumor-derived DNA in the serum by two orders of magnitude. This work is the first demonstration of enhanced extracellular vesicle release by ultrasound stimulation and suggests that nanodroplets/ultrasound offers promise for genetic profiling of tumor phenotype and aggressiveness by stimulating the release of extracellular vesicles.

Serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade F, member 1 (SERPINF1) is known to cause a distinct, extremely rare autosomal recessive form of type VI OI. Here we report, for the first time, the detection of SERPINF1 mutations in Chinese OI patients. We designed a novel targeted next-generation sequencing panel of OI-related genes to identify pathogenic mutations, which were confirmed with Sanger sequencing and by co-segregation analysis. We also investigated the phenotypes of OI patients by evaluating bone mineral density, radiological fractures, serum bone turnover markers, and pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) concentration. Six patients with moderate-to-severe bone fragility, significantly low bone mineral density, and severe deformities of the extremities were recruited from five unrelated families for this study. Six pathogenic mutations in SERPINF1 gene were identified, five of which were novel: (1) a homozygous in-frame insertion in exon 3 (c.271_279dup, p.Ala91_Ser93dup); (2) compound heterozygous mutations in intron 3 (c.283 + 1G > T, splicing site) and exon 5 (c.498_499delCA, p.Arg167SerfsX35, frameshift); (3) a homozygous frameshift mutation in exon 8 (c.1202_1203delCA, p.Thr401ArgfsX); (4) compound heterozygous missense mutation (c.184G > A, p.Gly62Ser) and in-frame insertion (c.271_279dup, p.Ala91_Ser93dup) in exon 3; and (5) a heterozygous nonsense mutation in exon 4 (c.397C > T + ?, p.Gln133X + ?). Serum PEDF levels were barely detectable in almost all subjects. We identified five novel mutations in SERPINF1 and confirmed the diagnostic value of serum PEDF level for the first time in Chinese patients with the extremely rare OI type VI.

It is also demonstrated that dietary factors can change the gut microbiota composition and obesity development. However, knowledge of how diet, metabolism and gut microbiota mutually interact and modulate energy metabolism and obesity development is still limited. Epidemiological studies indicate an association between intake of certain dietary protein sources and obesity. Animal studies confirm that different protein sources vary in their ability to either prevent or induce obesity. Different sources of protein such as beans, vegetables, dairy, seafood, and meat differ in amino acid composition. Further, the type and level of other factors, such as fatty acids and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) vary between dietary protein sources. All these factors can modulate the composition of the gut microbiota and may thereby influence their obesogenic properties. This review summarizes evidence of how different protein sources affect energy efficiency, obesity development, and the gut microbiota, linking protein-dependent changes in the gut microbiota with obesity.

Genomic variants in the FTO gene are associated with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in Greek patients	HUMAN GENOMICS			English	Article						Sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; FTO gene; Genomic variants; Whole-genome sequencing; Founder population	HEXANUCLEOTIDE REPEAT; MOTOR-NEURONS; ALS; MUTATIONS; PATHWAYS; INDIVIDUALS; EXPOSURE; SURVIVAL; ALLELES; DISEASE	Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating disease whose complex pathology has been associated with a strong genetic component in the context of both familial and sporadic disease. Herein, we adopted a next-generation sequencing approach to Greek patients suffering from sporadic ALS (together with their healthy counterparts) in order to explore further the genetic basis of sporadic ALS (sALS). Results: Whole-genome sequencing analysis of Greek sALS patients revealed a positive association between FTO and TBC1D1 gene variants and sALS. Further, linkage disequilibrium analyses were suggestive of a specific disease-associated haplotype for FTO gene variants. Genotyping for these variants was performed in Greek, Sardinian, and Turkish sALS patients. A lack of association between FTO and TBC1D1 variants and sALS in patients of Sardinian and Turkish descent may suggest a founder effect in the Greek population. FTO was found to be highly expressed in motor neurons, while in silico analyses predicted an impact on FTO and TBC1D1 mRNA splicing for the genomic variants in question. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to present a possible association between FTO gene variants and the genetic etiology of sALS. In addition, the next-generation sequencing-based genomics approach coupled with the two-step validation strategy described herein has the potential to be applied to other types of human complex genetic disorders in order to identify variants of clinical significance.

The achievement of chemically synthesized genomes with customized genetic features offers an opportunity to rebuild genome organization, remold biological functions and promote life evolution, which will be of great benefit for application in medicine and industrial manufacturing.

On VIII metals, metastable carbides usually evolve and then transform into graphene along the phase interfaces, and even no metal carbides can form on IB-IIB metals. In contrast, during graphene growth on group IVB-VIB metals, carbides are usually generated even before the evolution of graphene and stably exist throughout the whole growth process. However, for the remaining transition metals, e.g., group VIIB, located in between IVB-VIB and VIII, the interplay between graphene and carbide is still vague. Herein, on Re(0001) (VIIB), we have revealed a novel transition from graphene to metal carbide (reverse to that on VIII metals) for the first time. This transition experienced graphene decomposition, dissolution, and carbon segregation processes, as evidenced by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and on-site, variable-temperature low electron energy diffraction (LEED) characterizations. This work thus completes the picture about the interplay between graphene and carbide on/in transition metals in the periodic table, as well as discloses a new territory for the growth of carbon-related materials, especially the metal carbide.

In the present study, we applied an integrated bioinformatics approach to provide a novel perspective and identified some hub genes of prostate cancer. Microarray data of fifty-nine prostate cancer were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus. Gene Ontology and pathway analysis were applied for differentially expressed genes between high and low grade prostate cancer. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis was applied to construct gene network and classify genes into different modules. The most related module to high grade prostate cancer was identified and hub genes in the module were revealed. Ingenuity pathway analysis was applied to check the chosen module's relationship to high grade prostate cancer. Hub gene's expression profile was verified with clinical samples and a dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas project. 3193 differentially expressed genes were filtered and gene ontology and pathway analysis revealed some cancer- and sex hormone-related results. Weighted gene coexpression network was constructed and genes were classified into six modules. The red module was selected and ingenuity pathway analysis confirmed its relationship with high grade prostate cancer. Hub genes were identified and their expression profile was also confirmed. The present study applied integrate bioinformatics approaches to generate a holistic view of high grade prostate cancer and identified hub genes could serve as prognosis markers and potential treatment targets.

As such, its storage for biobanking is an important field of study. Traditionally, long-term storage in the cold (generally freezers or liquid nitrogen) is used to maintain high-quality (in terms of quantity and integrity) RNA. Room temperature (RT) preservation provides an alternative to the cold, which is plagued by serious problems (mainly cost and safety), for RNA long-term storage. In this study, we evaluated the performance of several RT storage procedures, including the RNAshell((R)) from Imagene, where the RNA is dried and kept protected from the atmosphere, and the vacuum drying of RNA with additives such as the Imagene stabilization solution and a home-made trehalose solution. This evaluation was performed through accelerated (equivalent to 10 years for RNAshell) aging and real-time studies (4 years). To check RNA quality and integrity, we used RNA integrity number values and RNA-seq. Our study shows that isolation from atmosphere offers a superior protective effect for RNA storage compared with vacuum drying alone, and demonstrates that RNAshell permits satisfactory RNA quality for long-term RT storage. Thus, the RNA quality could meet the demand of downstream applications such as RNA-seq.

However, only limited studies have explored the landscape of genomic alterations in lung adenocarcinoma derived from Asian patients thus far. In this single-center study, with an aim to elucidate the mutational profile of lung cancer in people of Chinese ethnicity and to use the obtained information to guide decision-making for treatment, we employed a well-validated assay to perform comprehensive genomic characterization of tumor specimens from 306 Chinese lung cancer patients. A total of 845 individual genomic alterations were found in 145 tumor-related genes with a median of 2.8 alterations (range: 1-18) per sample. The most frequently mutated genes were EGFR (46.7%), TP53 (21.2%), ALK (12.1%; 8.8% of mutation and 3.3% of rearrangement) and KRAS (10.1%). Upon comparison with the Cancer Genome Atlas dataset, we found that EGFR was mutated at a much higher frequency in our cohort than in Caucasians, whereas KRAS was only found in 10.1% of our Chinese patients. Clinically relevant genomic alterations were identified in 185 (60.5%) patients, including 50% in adenocarcinoma patients and 14% in squamous cell carcinoma patients. Our findings suggest that the Asian ethnicity is significantly different from the Caucasian ethnicity with regard to the presence of somatic driver mutations. Furthermore, we showed that the use of a comprehensive genotyping approach could help identify actionable genomic alterations that have potential impact on therapeutic decisions.

An Unexpectedly Complex Architecture for Skin Pigmentation in Africans	CELL			English	Article							GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; GENETIC-DETERMINANTS; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; REVEALS ADAPTATION; SOUTHERN AFRICA; COLOR VARIATION; MODERN HUMANS; HUMAN HEIGHT; EYE-COLOR; EUROPEANS	Approximately 15 genes have been directly associated with skin pigmentation variation in humans, leading to its characterization as a relatively simple trait. However, by assembling a global survey of quantitative skin pigmentation phenotypes, we demonstrate that pigmentation is more complex than previously assumed, with genetic architecture varying by latitude. We investigate polygenicity in the KhoeSan populations indigenous to southern Africa who have considerably lighter skin than equatorial Africans. We demonstrate that skin pigmentation is highly heritable, butknownpigmentation loci explainonly asmall fraction of the variance. Rather, baseline skin pigmentation is a complex, polygenic trait in the KhoeSan. Despite this, we identify canonical and non-canonical skin pigmentation loci, including near SLC24A5, TYRP1, SMARCA2/VLDLR, and SNX13, using a genome-wide association approach complemented by targeted resequencing. By considering diverse, under-studied African populations, we show how the architecture of skin pigmentation can vary across humans subject to different local evolutionary pressures.

Here we show that treatment with Acarbose, but not Glipizide, increases the ratio between primary BAs and secondary BAs and plasma levels of unconjugated BAs in treatment-naive type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients, which may beneficially affect metabolism. Acarbose increases the relative abundances of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium in the gut microbiota and depletes Bacteroides, thereby changing the relative abundance of microbial genes involved in BA metabolism. Treatment outcomes of Acarbose are dependent on gut microbiota compositions prior to treatment. Compared to patients with a gut microbiota dominated by Prevotella, those with a high abundance of Bacteroides exhibit more changes in plasma BAs and greater improvement in metabolic parameters after Acarbose treatment. Our work highlights the potential for stratification of T2D patients based on their gut microbiota prior to treatment.

However, information on the epigenetics-mediated immune mechanisms in insects is limited. Therefore, in this study, we examined transcriptomes and DNA methylomes in the fat body and midgut tissues of silkworm, Bombyx mori with or without B. mori cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus (BmCPV) infection. The transcriptional profile and the genomic DNA methylation patterns in the midgut and fat body were tissue-specific and dynamically altered after BmCPV challenge. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that differentially methylated genes (DMGs) could be involved in pathways of RNA transport, RNA degradation, nucleotide excision repair, DNA replication, etc. 27 genes were shown to have both differential expression and differential methylation in the midgut and fat body of infected larvae, respectively, indicating that the BmCPV infection-induced expression changes of these genes could be mediated by variations in DNA methylation. BS-PCR validated the hypomethylation of G2/M phase-specific E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase-like gene in the BmCPV infected midgut. These results demonstrated that epigenetic regulation may play roles in host-virus interaction in silkworm and would be potential value for further studies on mechanism of BmCPV epithelial-specific infection and epigenetic regulation in the silkworm.

Gentle AHB (gAHB), unknown anywhere else in the world, subsequently evolved on the island within a few generations. Here we sequence whole genomes from gAHB and EHB populations, as well as a North American AHB population, a likely source of the founder AHB on PR. We show that gAHB retains high levels of genetic diversity after evolution of gentle behaviour, despite selection on standing variation. We observe multiple genomic loci with significant signatures of selection. Rapid evolution during colonization of novel habitats can generate major changes to characteristics such as morphological or colouration traits, usually controlled by one or more major genetic loci. Here we describe a soft selective sweep, acting at multiple loci across the genome, that occurred during, and may have mediated, the rapid evolution of a behavioural trait.

Although several ESCC genomic sequencing studies have identified mutated somatic genes, the number of samples in each study was relatively small, and the molecular basis of ESCC has not been fully elucidated. Here, we performed an integrated analysis of 490 tumours by combining the genomic data from 7 previous ESCC projects. We identified 18 significantly mutated genes (SMGs). PTEN, DCDC1 and CUL3 were first reported as SMGs in ESCC. Notably, the AJUBA mutations and mutational signature4 were significantly correlated with a poorer survival in patients with ESCC. Hierarchical clustering analysis of the copy number alteration (CNA) of cancer gene census (CGC) genes in ESCC patients revealed three subtypes, and subtype3 exhibited more CNAs and marked for worse prognosis compared with subtype2. Moreover, database annotation suggested that two significantly differential CNA genes (PIK3CA and FBXW7) between subtype3 and subtype2 may serve as therapeutic drug targets. This study has extended our knowledge of the genetic basis of ESCC and shed some light into the clinical relevance, which would help improve the therapy and prognosis of ESCC patients.

BMC GENOMICS			English	Article						Chinese jujube; MAPKs; MAPKKs; Bioinformatics analysis; Gene expression	ACTIVATED PROTEIN-KINASES; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; EXPRESSION ANALYSIS; PLANT; CASCADES; STRESS; SIGNALS; CLONING; MPK6	Background: Chinese jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) is one of the most important members in the Rhamnaceae family. The whole genome sequence and more than 30,000 proteins of Chinese jujube have been obtained in 2014. Mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades are universal signal transduction modules in plants, which is rapidly activated under various biotic and abiotic stresses. To date, there has been no comprehensive analysis of the MAPK and MAPKK gene family in Chinese jujube at the whole genome level. Results: By performing a series of bioinformatics analysis, ten MAPK and five MAPKK genes were identified from the genome database of Chinese jujube, and then compared with the homologous genes from Arabidopsis. Phylogenetic analysis showed that ZjMAPKs was classified into four known groups, including A, B, C and D. ZjMAPKs contains five members of the TEY phosphorylation site and five members with the TDY motif. The ZjMAPKK family was subsequently divided into three groups, A, B and D. The gene structure, conserved motifs, functional annotation and chromosome distribution of ZjMAPKs and ZjMAPKKs were also predicted. ZjMAPKs and ZjMAPKKs were distributed on nine pseudo-chromosomes of Chinese jujube. Subsequently, expression analysis of ZjMAPK and ZjMAPKK genes using reverse transcription PCR and quantitative real-time PCR was carried out. The majority of ZjMAPK and ZjMAPKK genes were expressed in all tested organs/tissues with considerable differences in transcript levels indicating that they might be constitutively expressed. Moreover, ZjMKK5 was specific expressed in early development stage of jujube flower bud, indicating it plays some roles in reproductive organs development. The transcript expression of most ZjMAPK and ZjMAPKK genes was down-regulated in response to plant growth regulators, darkness treatment and phytoplasma infection. Conclusions: We identified ten ZjMAPK and five ZjMAPKK genes from the genome database of Chinese jujube, the research results shown that ZjMPKs and ZjMKKs have the different expression patterns, indicating that they might play different roles in response to various treatments. The results provide valuable information for the further elucidation of physiological functions and biological roles of jujube MAPKs and MAPKKs.

These two breeds are characterized by their soft cashmere fibers, thus making them great models to identify genomic regions that are associated with cashmere fiber traits. Whole-genome sequencing of 70 cashmere goats produced more than 5.52 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms and 710,600 short insertions and deletions. Further analysis of these genetic variants showed some population-specific molecular markers for the two cashmere goat breeds that are otherwise phenotypically similar. By analyzing F-ST and theta(pi) outlier values, we identified 135 genomic regions that were associated with cashmere fiber traits within the cashmere goat populations. These selected genomic regions contained genes, which are potential involved in the production of cashmere fiber, such as FGF5, SGK3, IGFBP7, OXTR, and ROCK1. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of identified short insertions and deletions also showed enrichment in keratinocyte differentiation and epidermal cell differentiation. These findings demonstrate that this genomic resource will facilitate the breeding of cashmere goat and other Capra species in future.

To obtain insights into the mechanism of ZIKV infection and pathogenesis, we analyzed the transcriptome of ZIKV infected human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) for changes in alternative splicing (AS), gene isoform (ISO) composition and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) expression. Methods: We analyzed differentially expressed lncRNAs, AS, ISO from RNA-seq data in ZIKV infected hNPCs. Results: We obtained 149 differentially expressed lncRNAs, including potential viral targets to modulate cellular processes such as cell cycle, apoptosis and immune response. The infection induced 262 cases of AS occurring in 229 genes, which were enriched in cell death, RNA processing, transport, and neuron development. Among 691 differentially expressed ISOs, upregulated ISOs were enriched in signaling, regulation of transcription, and amino acid biosynthesis, while downregulated ISOs were mostly enriched in cell cycle. Importantly, these analyses revealed specific links between ZIKV induced changes in cellular pathways and the type of changes in the host transcriptome, suggesting important regulatory mechanisms. Conclusions: Our analyses revealed candidate lncRNAs, AS events and ISOs which may function in ZIKV infection induced cell cycle disruption, apoptosis and attenuation of neurogenesis, and shed light on the roles of lncRNAs, AS and ISOs in virus-host interactions, and would facilitate future studies of ZIKV infection and pathogenesis.

Here, we describe a total of 119 patients with advanced EGFR-TKI-naive NSCLC and 15 EGFR-TKI-resistant patients to identify somatic SNVs, small indels, CNVs and gene fusions in 508 tumor-related genes. Somatic ctDNA mutations were detected in 82.8% (111/134) of patients in the total cohort. Of the 119 patients with advanced NSCLC, 27.7% (33/119) were suitable for treatment with National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline-approved targeted drugs. Actionable genetic alterations included 25 EGFR mutations, 5 BRAF mutations, and 1 MET mutation, as well as 1 EML4-ALK gene fusion and 1 KIF5B-RET gene fusion. In 19.3% (23/119) of the patients, we also identified genomic alterations with that could be targeted by agents that are in clinical trials, such as mTOR inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, and CDK4/6 inhibitors. Additionally, the EGFR T790M mutation was found in 46.7% (7/15) of the patients with EGFR-TKI-resistant NSCLC, suggesting that the NGS-based ctDNA assay might be an optional method to monitor EGFR-TKI resistance and to discover mechanisms of drug resistance.

Several models have been proposed to explain this transition, some involving male and female sterility mutations linked in a region of suppressed recombination between X and Y (or Z/W, U/V) chromosomes. Comparative and experimental analysis of a reference genome assembly for a double haploid YY male garden asparagus (Asparagus officinalis L.) individual implicates separate but linked genes as responsible for sex determination. Dioecy has evolved recently within Asparagus and sex chromosomes are cytogenetically identical with the Y, harboring a megabase segment that is missing from the X. We show that deletion of this entire region results in a male-to-female conversion, whereas loss of a single suppressor of female development drives male-to-hermaphrodite conversion. A single copy anther-specific gene with a male sterile Arabidopsis knockout phenotype is also in the Y-specific region, supporting a two-gene model for sex chromosome evolution.

It has been reported that ND is caused by mutations in the NDP gene. Although many mutations in NDP have been reported, the genetic cause for many patients remains unknown. In this study, the aim is to investigate the genetic defect in a five-generation family with typical symptoms of ND. Methods: To identify the causative gene, next-generation sequencing based target capture sequencing was performed. Segregation analysis of the candidate variant was performed in additional family members using Sanger sequencing. Results: We identified a novel missense variant (c. 314C>A) located within the NDP gene. The mutation cosegregated within all affected individuals in the family and was not found in unaffected members. By happenstance, in this family, we also detected a known pathogenic variant of retinitis pigmentosa in a healthy individual. Conclusion: c. 314C>A mutation of NDP gene is a novel mutation and broadens the genetic spectrum of ND.

Although a large number of genetic variants associated with SLE have been identified, biomarkers that correlate with LN are extremely limited. In this study, we performed a comprehensive sequencing analysis of the whole MHC region in 1331 patients with LN and 1296 healthy controls and validated the independent associations in another 950 patients with LN and 1000 controls. We discovered five independent risk variants for LN within the MHC region, including HLA-DR beta 1 amino acid 11 (P-omnibus < 0.001), HLA-DQ beta 1 amino acid 45 (P < 0.001; odds ratio, 0.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.65), HLA-A amino acid 156 (P-omnibus < 0.001), HLA-DP beta 1 amino acid 76 (P-omnibus < 0.001), and a missense variant in PRRC2A (rs114580964; P < 0.001; odds ratio, 0.38; 95% confidence interval, 0.30 to 0.49) at genome-wide significance. These data implicate aberrant peptide presentation by MHC classes 1 and 2 molecules and sex hormone modulation in the development of LN.

For a species with a long generation time, traditional breeding and genetic improvement is predicted to take more than 20 years to obtain superior cultivars. Thus, marker-assisted selection (MAS) should be used to accelerate the breeding process. Development of a genetic linkage map and molecular markers are pre-requisites for MAS of crop species. Here, we report a genome-wide SNP-based genetic map of kiwifruit by analysing next-generation restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) reads. To construct a genetic linkage map, a 102 F1 line mapping population of Actinidia chinensis (2n = 58) was derived by combining parents that had contrasting phenotypic traits. The maternal map contained 4112 SNP loci and spanned a distance of 3821 cM, with an average adjacent-marker interval length of 0.929 cM. The map length of the 29 linkage groups ranged from 78.3 to 169.9 cM, with an average length of 131.8 cM. High levels of collinearity between the 29 genetic maps with the kiwifruit reference genome were found. The genetic map developed in this study can serve as an important platform to improve kiwifruit research, including anchoring unmapped scaffolds of the kiwifruit genome sequence and mapping QTLs (quantitative trait loci) that control economically important traits.

The vegetative nitrogen response of sorghum lines containing different alleles for nitrate reductase and glutamate synthase	MOLECULAR BREEDING			English	Article						Allelic variation; Sorghum; Nested association mapping population; Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE); Vegetative; Nitrate reductase; Glutamate	USE EFFICIENCY; GENETIC-VARIABILITY; BALANCING SELECTION; LEAF EXPANSION; PLANTS; CROP; NUTRITION; EVOLUTION; GENOTYPES; BICOLOR	Improving the nitrogen (N) responsiveness of crops is crucial for food security and environmental sustainability, and breeding N use efficient (NUE) crops has to exploit genetic variation for this complex trait. We used reverse genetics to examine allelic variation in two N metabolism genes. In silico analysis of the genomes of 44 genetically diverse sorghum genotypes identified a nitrate reductase and a glutamate synthase gene that were under balancing selection in improved sorghum cultivars. We hypothesised that these genes are a potential source of differences in NUE, and selected parents and progeny of nested association mapping populations with different allelic combinations for these genes. Allelic variation was sourced from African (Macia) and Indian (ICSV754) genotypes that had been incorporated into the Australian elite parent R931945-2-2. Nine genotypes were grown for 30 days in a glasshouse and supplied with continuous limiting or replete N, or replete N for 27 days followed by 3 days of N starvation. Biomass, total N and nitrate contents were quantified together with gene expressions in leaves, stems and roots. Limiting N supply universally resulted in less shoot and root growth, increased root weight ratio and reduced tissue nitrate and total N concentrations. None of the tested genotypes exceeded growth or NUE of the elite parent R931945-2-2 indicating that the allelic combinations did not confer an advantage during early vegetative growth. Thus, the next steps for ascertaining potential effects on NUE include growing plants to maturity. We conclude that reverse genetics that take advantage of rapidly expanding genomic databases enable a systematic approach for developing N-efficient crops.

Targeted region capture sequencing focuses on a panel of known pathogenic genes and provides a rapid, cost-effective and accurate method for molecular diagnosis. In a Chinese family, this method was used on the proband and Sanger sequencing was applied to validate the candidate mutation. A de novo heterozygous mutation (c. 3254_ 3255insT p. Leu1085PhefsX24) of the jagged 1 gene was identified as the potential disease-causing gene mutation. In conclusion, the present study suggested that target region capture sequencing is an efficient, reliable and accurate approach for the clinical diagnosis of AGS. Furthermore, these results expand on the understanding of the pathogenesis of AGS.

By genome sequencing, physical mapping and transcriptome analysis, we found that the gene families encoding receptors for bitter or toxic substances and detoxification enzymes, such as cytochrome P450, carboxylesterase and glutathione-S-transferase, were massively expanded in this polyphagous species, enabling its extraordinary ability to detect and detoxify many plant secondary compounds. Larval exposure to insecticidal toxins induced expression of detoxification genes, and knockdown of representative genes using short interfering RNA (siRNA) reduced larval survival, consistent with their contribution to the insect's natural pesticide tolerance. A population genetics study indicated that this species expanded throughout southeast Asia by migrating along a South India-South China-Japan axis, adapting to wide-ranging ecological conditions with diverse host plants and insecticides, surviving and adapting with the aid of its expanded detoxification systems. The findings of this study will enable the development of new pest management strategies for the control of major agricultural pests such as S.litura.

Cultivation and breeding of B. napus by humans has resulted in numerous genetically diverse morphotypes with optimized agronomic traits and ecophysiological adaptation. To further understand the genetic basis of diversification and adaptation, we report a draft genome of an Asian semi-winter oilseed rape cultivar 'ZS11' and its comprehensive genomic comparison with the genomes of the winter-type cultivar 'Darmor-bzh' as well as two progenitors. The integrated BAC-to-BAC and whole-genome shotgun sequencing strategies were effective in the assembly of repetitive regions (especially young long terminal repeats) and resulted in a high-quality genome assembly of B. napus 'ZS11'. Within a short evolutionary period (similar to 6700years ago), semi-winter-type 'ZS11' and the winter-type 'Darmor-bzh' maintained highly genomic collinearity. Even so, certain genetic differences were also detected in two morphotypes. Relative to Darmor-bzh', both two subgenomes of 'ZS11' are closely related to its progenitors, and the 'ZS11' genome harbored several specific segmental homoeologous exchanges (HEs). Furthermore, the semi-winter-type 'ZS11' underwent potential genomic introgressions with B. rapa (A(r)). Some of these genetic differences were associated with key agronomic traits. A key gene of A03.FLC3 regulating vernalization-responsive flowering time in 'ZS11' was first experienced HE, and then underwent genomic introgression event with A(r), which potentially has led to genetic differences in controlling vernalization in the semi-winter types. Our observations improved our understanding of the genetic diversity of different B. napus morphotypes and the cultivation history of semi-winter oilseed rape in Asia. Significance Statement We generated a high-quality reference genome sequence of semi-winter Brassica napus. Our BAC-to-BAC strategy was effective in the assembly of repetitive regions. The main phenotypic difference between semi-winter and winter B. napus morphotypes is the vernalization requirement. Here, we found that a key gene controlling the vernalization-responsive flowering time was altered in the semi-winter type ZS11' through both homoeologous exchanges and genomic introgression with B. rapa.

MERR.; MIXED-MODEL; STRUCTURED POPULATIONS; LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM; HAPLOTYPE BLOCKS; AGRONOMIC TRAITS; SELECTION; PREDICTION; IMPROVEMENT; VARIANCE	The innovative RTM-GWAS procedure provides a relatively thorough detection of QTL and their multiple alleles for germplasm population characterization, gene network identification, and genomic selection strategy innovation in plant breeding. The previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been concentrated on finding a handful of major quantitative trait loci (QTL), but plant breeders are interested in revealing the whole-genome QTL-allele constitution in breeding materials/germplasm (in which tremendous historical allelic variation has been accumulated) for genome-wide improvement. To match this requirement, two innovations were suggested for GWAS: first grouping tightly linked sequential SNPs into linkage disequilibrium blocks (SNPLDBs) to form markers with multi-allelic haplotypes, and second utilizing two-stage association analysis for QTL identification, where the markers were preselected by single-locus model followed by multi-locus multi-allele model stepwise regression. Our proposed GWAS procedure is characterized as a novel restricted two-stage multi-locus multi-allele GWAS (RTM-GWAS). The Chinese soybean germplasm population (CSGP) composed of 1024 accessions with 36,952 SNPLDBs (generated from 145,558 SNPs, with reduced linkage disequilibrium decay distance) was used to demonstrate the power and efficiency of RTM-GWAS. Using the CSGP marker information, simulation studies demonstrated that RTM-GWAS achieved the highest QTL detection power and efficiency compared with the previous procedures, especially under large sample size and high trait heritability conditions. A relatively thorough detection of QTL with their multiple alleles was achieved by RTM-GWAS compared with the linear mixed model method on 100-seed weight in CSGP. A QTL-allele matrix (402 alleles of 139 QTL x 1024 accessions) was established as a compact form of the population genetic constitution. The 100-seed weight QTL-allele matrix was used for genetic characterization, candidate gene prediction, and genomic selection for optimal crosses in the germplasm population.

The developmental hourglass model attributes this to phylum-wide conserved, constrained organogenesis stages that pattern the bodyplan (the phylotype hypothesis); however, there has been no quantitative testing of this idea with a phylum-wide comparison of species. Here, based on data from early-to-late embryonic transcriptomes collected from eight chordates, we suggest that the phylotype hypothesis would be better applied to vertebrates than chordates. Furthermore, we found that vertebrates' conserved mid-embryonic developmental programmes are intensively recruited to other developmental processes, and the degree of the recruitment positively correlates with their evolutionary conservation and essentiality for normal development. Thus, we propose that the intensively recruited genetic system during vertebrates' organogenesis period imposed constraints on its diversification through pleiotropic constraints, which ultimately led to the common anatomical pattern observed in vertebrates.

However, most previous SCPP studies focused on phylogenetically distant animals but not on those closely related species. Here we provide novel insights into the coevolution of SCPP genes and fish scales in 10 species from Otophysi. According to their scale phenotypes, these fishes can be divided into three groups, i.e., scaled, sparsely scaled, and scaleless. We identified homologous SCPP genes in the genomes of these species and revealed an absence of some SCPP members in some genomes, suggesting an uneven evolutionary history of SCPP genes in fishes. In addition, most of these SCPP genes, with the exception of SPP1, individually form one or two gene cluster(s) on each corresponding genome. Furthermore, we constructed phylogenetic trees using maximum likelihood method to estimate their evolution. The phylogenetic topology mostly supports two subclasses in some species, such as Cyprinus carpio, Sinocyclocheilus anshuiensis, S. grahamin, and S. rhinocerous, but not in the other examined fishes. By comparing the gene structures of recently reported candidate genes, SCPP1 and SCPP5, for determining scale phenotypes, we found that the hypothesis is suitable for Astyanax mexicanus, but denied by S. anshuiensis, even though they are both sparsely scaled for cave adaptation. Thus, we conclude that, although different fish species display similar scale phenotypes, the underlying genetic changes however might be diverse. In summary, this paper accelerates the recognition of the SCPP family in teleosts for potential scale evolution.

As longevity population is a good healthy aging model for understanding how the body begin aging and the process of aging, and plasma lipids metabolism and balance is a very important to life maintain and physiologic functional turnover. It is important to explore how the effect of genetic variants associated long-life individuals on lipids metabolism and balance. Therefore, we developed a comparative study based population which contains 2816 longevity and 2819 control. Through whole-exome sequencing and sanger sequencing genotypes, we identified four new single nucleotide polymorphisms of HLA-DQB1(major histocompatibility complex, class II, DQ beta 1), rs41542812 rs1049107 rs1049100 rs3891176(P-range=0.048- 2.811x10(-8) for allele frequencies), associated with longevity in Chinese Longevity Cohort. Further, by analysis of the longevity-variants linked to blood lipids, we identified HLA-DQB1 rs1049107, T-carriers (P-HDL=0.006, OR: 11.277; P-TG=9.095x10(-7), OR: 0.025; P-LDL/HDL=0.047, OR: 1.901) and HLA-DQB1 rs1049100, T-carriers (P-TG=1.799x10(-6), OR: 0.028) associated with lipid homeostasis in long lived individuals. Our finding showed that longevity and lipid homeostasis were associated with HLA-DQB1 and suggested that immune gene variants could act on both new function of maintaining the homeostasis and anti-aging in longevity.

However, no big-data-based analysis on AMPs from any fish species is available. In this study, we identified 507 AMP transcripts on the basis of our previously reported genomes and transcriptomes of two representative amphibious mudskippers, Boleophthalmus pectinirostris (BP) and Periophthalmus magnuspinnatus (PM). The former is predominantly aquatic with less time out of water, while the latter is primarily terrestrial with extended periods of time on land. Within these identified AMPs, 449 sequences are novel; 15 were reported in BP previously; 48 are identically overlapped between BP and PM; 94 were validated by mass spectrometry. Moreover, most AMPs presented differential tissue transcription patterns in the two mudskippers. Interestingly, we discovered two AMPs, hemoglobin 1 and amylin, with high inhibitions on Micrococcus luteus. In conclusion, our high-throughput screening strategy based on genomic and transcriptomic data opens an efficient pathway to discover new antimicrobial peptides for ongoing development of marine drugs.

Here, we first conducted a whole-exome sequencing and linkage analysis on a three-generation Chinese family with autosomal-dominant (AD) AIS, and then performed targeted sequencing in a discovery cohort comprising 20 AD AIS families and 86 simplex patients, and finally identified three disease-associated missense variants (c.886G>A, c.1943C>T, and c.1760C>T) in the MAPK7 gene (encoding mitogen-activated protein kinase 7). Genotyping of the three rare variants in a Chinese replication cohort comprising 1,038 simplex patients and 1,841 controls showed that their combined allele frequency was significantly over-represented in patients as compared with controls (2.0% [41/2,076] vs. 0.7% [27/3,682]; odds ratio = 2.7; P=2.8 x 10(-5)). In vitro, we demonstrated that the three MAPK7 mutants disrupted nuclear translocation in cellular models, which is necessary for the normal function of MAPK7. In vivo, we also conducted CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of mapk7 in zebrafish recapitulating the characteristic phenotype of idiopathic scoliosis. Taken together, our findings suggest that rare coding variants in MAPK7 predispose to AIS, providing clues to understanding the mechanisms of AIS.

Composition and Variation Analysis of the T Cell Receptor -Chain Complementarity Determining Region 3 Repertoire in Neonatal Sepsis	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article							DIVERSITY; SEQUENCE; IMMUNITY; PATIENT; BIAS	T cell receptor (TCR) diversity is clearly related to protection from infection. However, the characteristics of TCR diversity in neonates are not clear. In this study, we investigated the TCR diversity of neonates with sepsis. Twenty neonates with severe sepsis and eight matched neonates without infection were enrolled in the study. For the neonates with sepsis, EDTA-anticoagulated blood was collected on day 1 after the diagnosis of sepsis and on day 7 of treatment. For the neonates without infection, blood was collected one time. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) gene was analysed by multiplex PCR and high-throughput sequencing. The CDR3 types and lengths were similar in patients and healthy controls. There was a significant difference in VJ gene usage among the three groups. Compared to the healthy neonates, the neonates with sepsis had different VJ pairs and generated different clonotypes. Although the TCR -chain diversity was generally lower in the neonates with sepsis, there was no significant difference in TCR -chain diversity between the patients and the healthy controls. Our data showed the characteristics of the TCR repertoire in neonates with sepsis, which represents a potentially valuable data set. This result is useful for understanding neonatal susceptibility to infection.

In this study, we demonstrate by transmission electron microscopy that in the post-lactating mammary gland interscapular multilocular adipocytes found close to the mammary alveoli contain milk protein granules. Use of the Cre-loxP recombination system allowed showing that the involuting mammary gland of whey acidic protein-Cre/R26R mice, whose secretory alveolar cells express the lacZ gene during pregnancy, contains some X-Gal-stained and uncoupling protein 1-positive interscapular multilocular adipocytes. These data suggest that during mammary gland involution some milk-secreting epithelial cells in the anterior subcutaneous depot may transdifferentiate to brown adipocytes, highlighting a hitherto unappreciated feature of mouse adipose organ plasticity.

Causative variants in genes such as BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 have been shown to account for hereditary nature of certain breast cancers. However, other genes, such as ATM, PALB2, BRIP1, CHEK, BARD1, while lower in frequency, may also increase breast cancer risk. There are few studies examining the role of these causative variants. Our study aimed to examine the clinical and genetic characterization of hereditary breast cancer in a Chinese population. Methods: We tested a panel of 27 genes implicated in breast cancer risk in 240 participants using Next-Generation Sequencing. The prevalence of genetic causative variants was determined and the association between causative variants and clinico-pathological characteristics was analyzed. Results: Causative variant rate was 19.2% in the breast cancer (case) group and 12.5% in the high-risk group. In the case group 2.5% of patients carried BRCA1 causative variant, 7.5% BRCA2 variants, 1.7% patients had MUTYH, CHEK or PALB2 variants, and 0.8% patients carried ATM, BARD1, NBN, RAD51C or TP53 variants. In the high-risk group 5. 8% women carried MUTYH causative variants, 2.5% had causative variants in ATM, 1.7% patients had variants in BRCA2 and 0.8% in BARD1, BRIP1 or CDH1. There was no significant difference in the presence of causative variants among clinical stages of breast cancer, tumor size and lymph nodes status. However, eight of the 12 BRCA1/2 causative variants were found in the TNBC group. Conclusions: We found increased genetic causative variants in the familial breast cancer group and in high-risk women with a family history of breast cancer. However, the variant MUTYH c.892-2A > G may not be directly associated with hereditary breast carcinoma.

Although combined surgical therapy and chemoradiotherapy have improved the survival for patients with HPC over the past 3 decades, the mortality rate in late-stage diagnosis of HPC is unsatisfactory. In this study, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) of 23 hypopharyngeal tumor and paired adjacent normal tissue to identify novel candidate driver genes associated with hypopharyngeal carcinoma. We identified several copy number variants (CNVs) and 15 somatic mutation genes that were associated with hypopharyngeal carcinoma. Mutations in nine new genes (PRB4, NSD1, REC8, ZNF772, ZNF69, EI24, CYFIP2, NEFH, KRTAP4-5) were also indentified. PRB4 and NSD1 expression were significantly upregulated in hypopharyngeal carcinoma, which was confirmed in an independent cohort using IHC. There was a positive relationship between PRB4 and NSD1. Downregulation of PRB4 by siRNA could inhibit cell growth, colony formation and cell invasion. Notably, we here demonstrate that NSD1 could bind to the promoter regions of PRB4 and activate promoter activity by reducing the binding of H3K27me2 and increasing the binding of H3K36me2 on PRB4 promoter. In summary, we pinpoint the predominant mutations in hypopharyngeal carcinoma by WES, highlighting the substantial genetic alterations contributing to hypopharyngeal carcinoma tumorigenesis. We also indentify a novel epigenetically regulatory between PRB4 and NSD1 that contribute to hypopharyngeal carcinoma tumorigenesis. They may become potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic target for hypopharyngeal carcinoma treatment.

Here we systematically sample the microbiota within the female reproductive tract in 110 women of reproductive age, and examine the nature of colonisation by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and cultivation. We find distinct microbial communities in cervical canal, uterus, fallopian tubes and peritoneal fluid, differing from that of the vagina. The results reflect a microbiota continuum along the female reproductive tract, indicative of a non-sterile environment. We also identify microbial taxa and potential functions that correlate with the menstrual cycle or are over-represented in subjects with adenomyosis or infertility due to endometriosis. The study provides insight into the nature of the vagino-uterine microbiome, and suggests that surveying the vaginal or cervical microbiota might be useful for detection of common diseases in the upper reproductive tract.

Methods: All the family members underwent medical history evaluation, ophthalmologic and physical examinations. Whole exome sequencing was performed on two affected individuals and their parents. All variants were verified in all family members by PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing. Results: Patients in this family were diagnosed as Bardet-Biedl syndrome, with an inheritance pattern of autosomal recessive. Compound heterozygous mutations of the FBN3 gene (c.3616G>A and c.6037C>T) were identified by whole exome sequencing. Results from Sanger sequencing showed co-segregation of these compound heterozygous mutations in the FBN3 gene with BBS disease in the family. Conclusion: Novel compound heterozygous mutations c.3616G>A and c.6037C>T of FBN3 were identified in all affected individuals but not in the unaffected family members. This is the first time to the best of our knowledge, that the FBN3 gene is involved in the pathogenesis of BBS. This study will expand our understanding about the gene spectrum related to this genetically heterogeneous disorder.

In addition to the optimization of reagents and conditions, complete physical separation of the entire reaction system into numerous tiny chambers or droplets using microfluidic devices, has been proven efficient to mitigate this amplifying bias in recent works. Here, we present another MDA advance, microchannel MDA (mu cMDA), which decentralizes MDA reagents throughout a one-dimensional slender tube. Due to the double effect from soft partition of high molecular-weight DNA molecules and less-limited diffusion of small particles, mu cMDA is shown to be significantly effective at improving the amplification uniformity, which enables us to accurately detect single nucleotide variants (SNVs) with higher efficiency and sensitivity. More importantly, this straightforward method requires neither customized instruments nor complicated operations, making it a ready-to-use technique in almost all biological laboratories.

Genetically improved farmed tilapia (GIFT, Oreochromis niloticus), an important aquaculture species in China, is susceptible to hepatic steatosis when reared in intensive culture systems. To investigate the miRNAs involved in GIFT lipid metabolism, two hepatic small RNA libraries from high fat diet-fed and normal-fat diet-fed GIFT were constructed and sequenced using high-throughput sequencing technology. A total of 204 known and 56 novel miRNAs were identified by aligning the sequencing data with known Danio rerio miRNAs listed in miRBase 21.0. Six known miRNAs.(miR-30a-5p, miR-34a, miR-145-5p, miR-29a, miR-205-5p, and miR-23a-3p) that were differentially expressed between the high-fat diet and normal-fat diet groups were validated by quantitative real-time PCR. Bioinformatics tools were used to predict the potential target genes of these differentially expressed miRNAs, and Gene Ontology enrichment analysis indicated that these miRNAs may play important roles in diet-induced hepatic steatosis in GIFT. Our results provide a foundation for further studies of the role of miRNAs in tilapia lipid homeostasis regulation, and may help to identify novel targets for therapeutic interventions to reduce the occurrence of fatty liver disease in farmed tilapia.

Materials and Methods: A large pedigree with a high incidence of disc degeneration was recruited for this study. Exome sequencing was completed on four family members with disc degeneration to screen for potential causal gene variants. Detected variants were filtered against the 1000 Genomes Project, the Short Genetic Variations database (dbSNP), and the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) in-house database. After removing synonymous variants, Sanger sequencing was used to verify the lack of the candidate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in five healthy subjects of the study family. Results: We identified a novel SNP variant, Chr12:g.53494591T>C. c.T430C (p.S144P) in the insulin-like growth factor binding protein-6 (IGFBP6) gene. This variant was shared by all four affected family members, but not by five unaffected members in the same pedigree. Furthermore, this variant was not detected in 200 unrelated healthy people. Conclusions: The c.T430C (p.S144P) variant of IGFBP6 was identified as the likely causal variant associated with increased risk of familial disc degeneration in the studied pedigree.

There is growing evidence of the important role of long non-coding RNAs in cancer initiation, development and progression. In this study, we sought to evaluate the long non-coding RNA expression profile of patients with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (AML). RNA-sequencing of 40 cytogenetically normal AML patients allowed us to quantify 11,036 long non-coding RNAs. Among these, more than 8000 were previously undescribed long non-coding RNAs. Using unsupervised analysis, we observed a specific long non-coding RNA expression profile dependent on the mutational status of the NPM1 gene. Statistical analysis allowed us to identify a minimal set of 12 long non-coding RNAs capable of discriminating NPM1-mutated from NPM1-wild-type patients. These results were validated by qRT-PCR on an independent cohort composed of 134 cytogenetically normal AML patients. Furthermore, we have identified one putative biomarker, the long non-coding RNA XLOC_109948 whose expression pattern predicts clinical outcome. Interestingly, low XLOC_109948 expression indicates a good prognosis especially for NPM1-mutated patients. Transient transfection of GapmeR against XLOC_109948 in NPM1-mutated OCI-AML3 cell line treated with AraC or ATRA enhances apoptosis suggesting XLOC_109948 plays a role in drug sensitivity. This study improves our knowledge of the long non-coding RNA transcriptome in cytogenetically normal AML patients. We observed a distinct long non-coding RNA expression profile in patients with the NPM1 mutation. The newly identified XLOC_109948 long non-coding RNA emerged as a strong prognostic factor able to better stratify NPM1-mutated patients.

These discrepancies are highly relevant to widely used biodiversity assessment approaches, such as DNA barcoding, that rely almost exclusively on mitochondrial markers. Although the theoretical causes of mito-nuclear discordances are well understood, it is often extremely challenging to determine the principal underlying factor in a given study system. In this study, we uncovered significant mito-nuclear discordances in a pair of sibling caddisfly species. Application of genome sequencing, ddRAD and DNA barcoding revealed ongoing hybridization, as well as historical hybridization in Pleistocene refugia, leading us to identify introgression as the ultimate cause of the observed discordance pattern. Our novel genomic data, the discovery of a European-wide hybrid zone and the availability of established techniques for laboratory breeding make this species pair an ideal model system for studying species boundaries with ongoing gene flow.

More than 50,000 protein-coding genes were predicted, a majority of which could be anchored to 23 pseudochromosomes obtained through a newly constructed genetic map. The oleaster genome contains signatures of two Oleaceae lineage-specific paleopolyploidy events, dated at similar to 28 and similar to 59 Mya. These events contributed to the expansion and neo-functionalization of genes and gene families that play important roles in oil biosynthesis. The functional divergence of oil biosynthesis pathway genes, such as FAD2, SACPD, EAR, and ACPTE, following duplication, has been responsible for the differential accumulation of oleic and linoleic acids produced in olive compared with sesame, a closely related oil crop. Duplicated oleaster FAD2 genes are regulated by an siRNA derived from a transposable element-rich region, leading to suppressed levels of FAD2 gene expression. Additionally, neofunctionalization of members of the SACPD gene family has led to increased expression of SACPD2,3, 5, and 7, consequently resulting in an increased desaturation of steric acid. Taken together, decreased FAD2 expression and increased SACPD expression likely explain the accumulation of exceptionally high levels of oleic acid in olive. The oleaster genome thus provides important insights into the evolution of oil biosynthesis and will be a valuable resource for oil crop genomics.

N-acetylserotonin methyltransferase (ASMT, also known as hydroxyindole O-methyltransferase or HIOMT) is the final enzyme for biosynthesis of melatonin. Here, we performed a comparative genomic and transcriptomic survey to explore the ASMT family in fish. Two ASMT isotypes (ASMT1 and ASMT2) and a new ASMT-like (ASMTL) are all extracted from teleost genomes on the basis of phylogenetic and synteny analyses. We confirmed that C-terminal of the ASMTL proteins (ASMTL-ASMT) is homology to the full length of ASMT1 and ASMT2. Our results also demonstrate that the two ASMT isotypes and their distribution in teleosts seem to be the result of combinations of whole-genome duplication (WGD) and gene loss. Differences were also observed in tissue distribution and relative transcript abundances of ASMT1, ASMT2 and ASMTL through transcriptomic analysis. Protein sequence alignment and 3D structure prediction of ASMTs and ASMTL suggest differential roles for these ASMT genes. In summary, our current work provides novel insights into the ASMT genes in fish by combination of genomic and transcriptomic data.

To attempt to identify and characterize the gene or quantitative trait locus (QTL) related to HC and to provide a basis for quality and yield breeding of foxtail millet, a restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) analysis was employed to reveal genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and to genotype the F-2 progeny from a cross between two cultivars: Heizhigu with green HC and Changnong 35 with yellow HC. A high-density linkage map spanning 1542.87 cM was constructed using 1694 bin markers, consisting of 46,256 SNP markers, and a QTL locus controlling HC was identified and temporarily named as Sihc1 (Setaria italica hull color). Results showed that Sihc1 was located in the interval between markers M33926512 and M34281352 on the end of chromosome 6, and explained 80.26% of the phenotypic variation with a logarithm of odds ratio of 93.46. The additive and dominant effects of Sihc1 were 1.0025 and -0.9991, respectively. Sihc1 was narrowed to a 354.84 kb physical region, inclusive of 30 open reading frames, and further analysis suggested that Seita. 6G226500, Seita. 6G226800, Seita. 6G228300, and Seita. 6G228600 might be the key candidates of Sihc1.

Gene mutation spectrum and genotype-phenotype correlation in a cohort of Chinese osteogenesis imperfecta patients revealed by targeted next generation sequencing	OSTEOPOROSIS INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Genotype-phenotypecorrelation; Nextgeneration sequencing; Osteogenesis imperfecta	CLINICAL-DIAGNOSIS; HELICAL DOMAIN; COLLAGEN; BONE; OSTEOPOROSIS; ADOLESCENTS; CHILDREN; ONSET; VI	The Summary The achievement of more accurate diagnosis would greatly benefit the management of patients with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). In this study, we present the largest OI sample in China as screened by next generation sequencing. In particular, we successfully identified 81 variants, which included 45 novel variants. We further did a genotype-phenotype analysis, which helps make a better understanding of OI. Introduction This study aims to reveal the gene mutation spectrum and the genotype-phenotype relationship among Chinese OI patients by next generation sequencing (NGS). Methods We developed a NGS-based panel for targeted sequencing of all exons of 14 genes related to OI, and performed diagnostic gene sequencing for a cohort of 103 Chinese OI patients from 101 unrelated families. Mutations identified by NGS were further confirmed by Sanger sequencing and co-segregation analysis. Results Of the 103 patients from 101 unrelated OI families, we identified 79 mutations, including 43 novel mutations (11 frameshift, 17 missense, 5 nonsense, 9 splice site, and 1 chromosome translocation) in 90 patients (87.4%). Mutations in genes encoding type I collagen, COL1A1 (n = 37), and COL1A2 (n = 29) accounts for 73.3% of all molecularly diagnosed patients, followed by IFITM5 (n = 9, 10%), SERPINF1 (n = 4, 4.4%), WNT1 (n = 4, 4.4%), FKBP10 (n = 3, 3.3%), TMEM38B (n = 3, 3.3%), and PLOD2 (n = 1, 1.1%). This corresponds to 75 autosomal dominant inherited (AD) OI patients and 15 autosomal recessive (AR) inherited patients. Compared with AD inherited OI patients, AR inherited patients had lower bone mineral density (BMD) at spine (P = 0.05) and less frequent blue sclera (P = 0.001). Patients with type I collagen qualitative defects had lower femoral neck BMD Z-score (P = 0.034) and were shorter compared with patients with type I collagen quantitative defects (P = 0.022). ConclusionWe revealed the gene mutation spectrum in Chinese OI patients, and novel mutations identified here expanded the mutation catalog and genotype and phenotype relationships among OI patients.

Small RNA Activity in Archeological Barley Shows Novel Germination Inhibition in Response to Environment	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						ancient RNA; miRNA; adaptation	STRESS-REGULATED MICRORNAS; PLANT RETROTRANSPOSONS; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; ALLELIC VARIATION; GENE-EXPRESSION; ANCIENT DNA; WHEAT; TARGETS; MIR319; MIRNAS	The recovery of ancient RNA from archeological material could enable the direct study of microevolutionary processes. Small RNAs are a rich source of information because their small size is compatible with biomolecular preservation, and their roles in gene regulation make them likely foci of evolutionary change. We present here the small RNA fraction from a sample of archeological barley generated using high-throughput sequencing that has previously been associated with localized adaptation to drought. Its microRNA profile is broadly similar to 19 globally distributed modern barley samples with the exception of three microRNAs (miRNA159, miRNA319, and miR396), all of which are known to have variable expression under stress conditions. We also found retrotransposon activity to be significantly reduced in the archeological barley compared with the controls, where one would expect the opposite under stress conditions. We suggest that the archeological barley's conflicting stress signals could be the result of long-term adaptation to its local environment.

Clinically, FAP is characterized by the development of multiple colorectal adenomas or polyps which finally result in colorectal cancer by the 40 years age of the patient, if no surgical interventions have been undertaken. In this study, we present a clinical molecular study of a four generation Chinese family with FAP. Diagnosis of FAP was made on the basis of clinical manifestations, family history and medical (colonoscopy and histopathology) records. Genetic screening of the proband and all affected family members were performed by targeted next-generation sequencing and confirmatory Sanger sequencing. Targeted next generation sequencing identified a germline novel heterozygous single nucleotide deletion [c. 3418delC; p.

In this study, Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) were exposed to Cd for 9 days and their gills were subjected to proteomic analysis, which were further confirmed with transcriptomic analysis. A total of 4,964 proteins was quantified and 515 differentially expressed proteins were identified in response to Cd exposure. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis revealed that excess Cd affected the DNA and protein metabolism. Specifically, Cd toxicity resulted in the inhibition of DNA glycosylase and gap-filling and ligation enzymes expressions in base excision repair pathway, which may have decreased DNA repair capacity. At the protein level, Cd induced the heat shock protein response, initiation of protein refolding as well as degradation by ubiquitin proteasome pathway, among other effects. Excess Cd also induced antioxidant responses, particularly glutathione metabolism, which play important roles in Cd chelation and anti-oxidation. This study provided the first molecular mechanisms of Cd toxicity on DNA and protein metabolism at protein levels, and identified molecular biomarkers for Cd toxicity in oysters.

SESQUIPEDALIS; LINKAGE MAP; L. WALP.; FLOWERING TIME; BRASSICA-NAPUS; COWPEA; GENOME; DOMESTICATION; SYNTENY; IDENTIFICATION	Cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.] is an annual legume of economic importance and widely grown in the semi-arid tropics. However, high-density genetic maps of cowpea are still lacking. Here, we identified 34,868 SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) that were distributed in the cowpea genome based on the RAD sequencing (restriction-site associated DNA sequencing) technique using a population of 170 individuals (two cowpea parents and 168 F-2:3 progenies). Of these, 17,996 reliable SNPs were allotted to 11 consensus linkage groups (LGs). The length of the genetic map was 1,194.25 cM in total with a mean distance of 0.066 cM/SNP marker locus. Using this map and the F-2:3 population, combined with the CIM (composite interval mapping) method, eleven quantitative trait loci (QTL) of yield-related trait were detected on seven LGs (LG4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 11) in cowpea. These QTL explained 0.05-17.32% of the total phenotypic variation. Among these, four QTL were for pod length, four QTL for thousand-grain weight (TGW), two QTL for grain number per pod, and one QTL for carpopodium length. Our results will provide a foundation for understanding genes related to grain yield in the cowpea and genus Vigna.

The root microbial community structure has been extensively investigated by 16S/18S/ITS amplicons and metagenomic sequencing in crops and model plants. However, the functional associations between root microbes and host plant growth are poorly understood. This work investigates the root bacterial community of foxtail millet (Setaria italica) and its potential effects on host plant productivity. We determined the bacterial composition of 2882 samples from foxtail millet rhizoplane, rhizosphere and corresponding bulk soils from 2 well-separated geographic locations by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. We identified 16 109 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and defined 187 OTUs as shared rhizoplane core OTUs. The beta-diversity analysis revealed that microhabitat was the major factor shaping foxtail millet root bacterial community, followed by geographic locations. Large-scale association analysis identified the potential beneficial bacteria correlated with plant high productivity. Besides, the functional prediction revealed specific pathways enriched in foxtail millet rhizoplane bacterial community. We systematically described the root bacterial community structure of foxtail millet and found its core rhizoplane bacterial members. Our results demonstrated that host plants enrich specific bacteria and functions in the rhizoplane. The potentially beneficial bacteria may serve as a valuable knowledge foundation for bio-fertilizer development in agriculture.

Although genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses have been performed to investigate the pathogenesis of psoriasis, the role of metabolites in psoriasis, particularly of lipids, remains unclear. Lipids not only comprise the bulk of the cellular membrane bilayers but also regulate a variety of biological processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, immunity, angiogenesis, and inflammation. In this study, an untargeted lipidomics approach was used to study the lipid profiles in psoriasis and to identify lipid metabolite signatures for psoriasis through ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry. Plasma samples from 90 participants (45 healthy and 45 psoriasis patients) were collected and analyzed. Statistical analysis was applied to find different metabolites between the disease and healthy groups. In addition, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to validate differentially expressed lipids in psoriatic patient plasma. Finally, we identified differential expression of several lipids including lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphatidic acid (PA); among these metabolites, LPA, LysoPC, and PA were significantly increased, while PC and PI were down-regulated in psoriasis patients. We found that elements of glycerophospholipid metabolism such as LPA, LysoPC, PA, PI, and PC were significantly altered in the plasma of psoriatic patients; this study characterizes the circulating lipids in psoriatic patients and provides novel insight into the role of lipids in psoriasis.

They have been explored in therapeutic and agricultural aspects as they are toxic to many bacteria. A considerable amount of work has been conducted in analyzing 16S and metagenomics of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus). However, these datasets are still untapped resources. In this present study, a homologous search was performed to predict AMPs from our newly generated metagenome of grass carp. We identified five AMPs with high similarities to previously reported bacterial toxins, such as lantibiotic and class II bacteriocins. In addition, we observed that the top abundant genus in the GI microbiota of the grass carp was generally consistent with the putative AMP-producing strains, which are mainly from Lactobacillales. Furthermore, we constructed the phylogenetic relationship of these putative AMP-producing bacteria existing in the GI of grass carp and some popular commercial probiotics (commonly used for microecologics), demonstrating that they are closely related. Thus, these strains have the potential to be developed into novel microecologics. In a word, we provide a high-throughput way to discover AMPs from fish GI microbiota, which can be developed as alternative pathogen antagonists (toxins) for microecologics or probiotic supplements.

A comprehensive next-generation sequencing (NGS) test would greatly facilitate screening and diagnosis of these disorders. An NGS panel targeting the coding regions of hemoglobin genes and four modifier genes was designed. We validated the assay by using 2522 subjects affected with hemoglobinopathies and applied it to carrier testing in a cohort of 10,111 couples who were also screened through traditional methods. In the clinical genotyping analysis of 1182 beta-thalassemia subjects, we identified a group of additional variants that can be used for accurate diagnosis. In the molecular screening analysis of the 10,111 couples, we detected 4180 individuals in total who carried 4840 mutant alleles, and identified 186 couples at risk of having affected offspring. 12.1% of the pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants identified by our NGS assay, which were undetectable by traditional methods. Compared with the traditional methods, our assay identified an additional at-risk 35 couples. We describe a comprehensive NGS-based test that offers advantages over the traditional screening/molecular testing methods. To our knowledge, this is among the first large-scale population study to systematically evaluate the application of an NGS technique in carrier screening and molecular diagnosis of hemoglobinopathies.

SPECTRUM; NEAPOLIS	Purpose: Thalassemia is one of the most common monogenic diseases in southwestern China, especially among the Dai ethnic group. Here, we explore the feasibility of a next-generation sequencing (NGS) screening method specifically for the Dai people. Methods: Blood samples were obtained from Dai people for premarital screening. Double-blind, parallel hemoglobinopathy screening was conducted using both traditional hematological methods (red cell indexes and hemoglobin electrophoresis, then DNA sequencing) and an NGS approach. Results: Among 951 tested individuals, we found a thalassemia carrier rate of 49.5% (471/951) using the NGS screen, in contrast to 22.0% (209/951) found using traditional methods. Almost 74.8% (217/290) of alpha-thalassemia carriers and 30.5% (25/82) of composite alpha- and beta-thalassemia carriers were missed by traditional screens. The proportion of such alpha- and beta-thalassemia carriers among the Dai people is 8.6% (82/951). For beta-thalassemia carriers, the high ratio (66/99) of CD26 mutations may suggest a correlation between CD26 and the environmental adaption of the Dai people. Conclusions: Methodological comparisons demonstrate the superiority of NGS for both sensitivity and specificity, provide a comprehensive assessment of thalassemia screening strategies, and indicate that NGS is a competitive screening method, especially among populations with a high prevalence of disease.

By the 2D-FDTD analysis of proposed grating structure high reflectivity characteristics are obtained for multiple wavelength points over visible and near infrared regions. Parameters optimized in our work are filling factor, period and width of each layer. Reflectivity spectra for both TE and TM modes have peaks with 94% reflectance for multiple wavelengths. Modified proposed structure gives simulation results with flat bands which will filter out different colors at different wavelength ranges.

The aim of the present study was to identify associations between sequence-based Human Leukocyte Antigen Class II region alleles and asparaginase hypersensitivity in a Hungarian ALL population. Four-digit typing of HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1 loci was performed in 359 pediatric ALL patients by using next-generation sequencing method. Based on genotypic data of the two loci, haplotype reconstruction was carried out. In order to investigate the possible role of the HLA-DQ complex, the HLADQA1 alleles were also inferred. Multivariate logistic regression analysis and a Bayesian network-based approach were applied to identify relevant genetic risk factors of asparaginase hypersensitivity. Patients with HLA-DRB1*07: 01 and HLA-DQB1*02:02 alleles had significantly higher risk of developing asparaginase hypersensitivity compared to non-carriers [P= 4.56x10-5; OR= 2.86 (1.73-4.75) and P= 1.85x10-4; OR= 2.99 (1.685.31); n= 359, respectively]. After haplotype reconstruction, the HLADRB1* 07:01-HLA-DQB1* 02:02 haplotype was associated with an increased risk. After inferring the HLA-DQA1 alleles the HLA-DRB1*07:01-HLA-DQA1*02:01-HLA-DQB1*02:02 haplotype was associated with the highest risk of asparaginase hypersensitivity [P= 1.22x10-5; OR= 5.00 (2.43-10.29); n= 257]. Significantly fewer T-cell ALL patients carried the HLA-DQB1* 02:02 allele and the associated haplotype than did pre-B-cell ALL patients (6.5%; vs. 19.2%, respectively; P= 0.047). In conclusion, we identified a haplotype in the Human Leukocyte Antigen Class II region associated with a higher risk of asparaginase hypersensitivity. Our results confirm that variations in HLA-D region might influence the development of asparaginase hypersensitivity.

We have sequenced and assembled the pomegranate genome with 328 Mb anchored into nine pseudo-chromosomes and annotated 29 229 gene models. A Myrtales lineage-specific whole-genome duplication event was detected that occurred in the common ancestor before the divergence of pomegranate and Eucalyptus. Repetitive sequences accounted for 46.1% of the assembled genome. We found that the integument development gene INNER NO OUTER (INO) was under positive selection and potentially contributed to the development of the fleshy outer layer of the seed coat, an edible part of pomegranate fruit. The genes encoding the enzymes for synthesis and degradation of lignin, hemicelluloses and cellulose were also differentially expressed between soft-and hard-seeded varieties, reflecting differences in their accumulation in cultivars differing in seed hardness. Candidate genes for punicalagin biosynthesis were identified and their expression patterns indicated that gallic acid synthesis in tissues could follow different biochemical pathways. The genome sequence of pomegranate provides a valuable resource for the dissection of many biological and biochemical traits and also provides important insights for the acceleration of breeding. Elucidation of the biochemical pathway(s) involved in punicalagin biosynthesis could assist breeding efforts to increase production of this bioactive compound.

Yet, the mushroom's genetic architecture and the molecular mechanisms underlying its formation are largely unknown. Here we performed comparative transcriptomic analysis during Bailinggu's mycelia, primordia, and fruiting body stages to identify genes regulating fruiting body development and develop EST-SSR markers assessing the genetic value of breeding materials. The stage-specific and differentially expressed unigenes (DEGs) involved in morphogenesis, primary carbohydrate metabolism, cold stimulation and blue-light response were identified using GO and KEGG databases. These unigenes might help Bailinggu adapt to genetic and environmental factors that influence fructification. The most pronounced change in gene expression occurred during the vegetative-to-reproductive transition, suggesting that is most active and key for Bailinggu development. We then developed 26 polymorphic and informative EST-SSR markers to assess the genetic diversity in 82 strains of Bailinggu breeding materials. These EST-SSRs exhibited high transferability in closely related species P. eryngii var. ferulae and var. eryngii. Genetic population structure analysis indicated that China's Bailinggu has low introgression with these two varieties and likely evolved independently. These findings provide new genes, SSR markers, and germplasm to enhance the breeding of commercially cultivated Bailinggu.

Its distribution in southwest China covers several different habitats and environments. However, not much research had been conducted on Rhododendron spp. at the molecular level, which hinders understanding of its evolution, speciation, and synthesis of secondary metabolites, as well as its wide adaptability to different environments. Here, we report the genome assembly and gene annotation of R. delavayi var. delavayi (the second genome sequenced in the Ericaceae), which will facilitate the study of the family. The genome assembly will have further applications in genome-assisted cultivar breeding. The final size of the assembled R. delavayi var. delavayi genome (695.09 Mb) was close to the 697.94 Mb, estimated by k-mer analysis. A total of 336.83 gigabases (Gb) of raw Illumina HiSeq 2000 reads were generated from 9 libraries (with insert sizes ranging from 170 bp to 40 kb), achieving a raw sequencing depth of x482.6. After quality filtering, 246.06 Gb of clean reads were obtained, giving x352.55 coverage depth. Assembly using Platanus gave a total scaffold length of 695.09 Mb, with a contig N50 of 61.8 kb and a scaffold N50 of 637.83 kb. Gene prediction resulted in the annotation of 32 938 protein-coding genes. The genome completeness was evaluated by CEGMA and BUSCO and reached 95.97% and 92.8%, respectively. The gene annotation completeness was also evaluated by CEGMA and BUSCO and reached 97.01% and 87.4%, respectively. Genome annotation revealed that 51.77% of the R. delavayi genome is composed of transposable elements, and 37.48% of long terminal repeat elements (LTRs). The de novo assembled genome of R. delavayi var. delavayi (hereinafter referred to as R. delavayi) is the second genomic resource of the family Ericaceae and will provide a valuable resource for research on future comparative genomic studies in Rhododendron species. The availability of the R. delavayi genome sequence will hopefully provide a tool for scientists to tackle open questions regarding molecular mechanisms underlying environmental interactions in the genus Rhododendron, more accurately understand the evolutionary processes and systematics of the genus, facilitate the identification of genes encoding pharmaceutically important compounds, and accelerate molecular breeding to release elite varieties.

Previously, studies of birds, bats, and insects have detected molecular signatures of differing selection regimes in energy-related genes associated with flight evolution and/or loss. Here, using DNA sequences from more than 1000 nuclear and mitochondrial protein-coding genes obtained from insect transcriptomes, we conduct a broader exploration of which gene categories display positive and relaxed selection at the origin of flight as well as with multiple independent losses of flight. We detected a number of categories of nuclear genes more often under positive selection in the lineage leading to the winged insects (Pterygota), related to catabolic processes such as proteases, as well as splicing-related genes. Flight loss was associated with relaxed selection signatures in splicing genes, mirroring the results for flight evolution. Similar to previous studies of flight loss in various animal taxa, we observed consistently higher nonsynonymous-to-synonymous substitution ratios in mitochondrial genes of flightless lineages, indicative of relaxed selection in energy-related genes. While oxidative phosphorylation genes were not detected as being under selection with the origin of flight specifically, they were most often detected as being under positive selection in holometabolous (complete metamorphosis) insects as compared with other insect lineages. This study supports some convergence in gene-specific selection pressures associated with flight ability, and the exploratory analysis provided some new insights into gene categories potentially associated with the gain and loss of flight in insects.

The symptoms of FEVR vary widely among patients in the same family, and even between the two eyes of a given patient. This study was designed to identify the genetic defect in a patient cohort of ten Chinese families with a definitive diagnosis of FEVR. Methods: To identify the causative gene, next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based target capture sequencing was performed. Segregation analysis of the candidate variant was performed in additional family members by using Sanger sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR). Results: Of the cohort of ten FEVR families, six pathogenic variants were identified, including four novel and two known heterozygous mutations. Of the variants identified, four were missense variants, and two were novel heterozygous deletion mutations [LRP5, c.4053 DelC (p.Ile1351IlefsX88); TSPAN12, EX8Del]. The two novel heterozygous deletion mutations were not observed in the control subjects and could give rise to a relatively severe FEVR phenotype, which could be explained by the protein function prediction. Conclusions: We identified two novel heterozygous deletion mutations [LRP5, c.4053 DelC (p.Ile1351IlefsX88); TSPAN12, EX8Del] using targeted NGS as a causative mutation for FEVR. These genetic deletion variations exhibit a severe form of FEVR, with tractional retinal detachments compared with other known point mutations. The data further enrich the mutation spectrum of FEVR and enhance our understanding of genotype-phenotype correlations to provide useful information for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and effective genetic counseling.

NTCP is also a target of multiple drugs. We aimed to evaluate the medical consequences of the loss of function mutation p. Ser267Phe in SLC10A1. We identified eight individuals with homozygous p. Ser267Phe mutation in SLC10A1 and followed up for 8-90 months. We compared their total serum BAs and 6 species of BAs with 170 wild-type and 107 heterozygous healthy individuals. We performed in-depth medical examinations and exome sequencing in the homozygous individuals. All homozygous individuals had persistent hypercholanemia (P = 5.8 x 10(-29)). Exome sequencing excluded the involvement of other BA metabolism-associated genes in the hypercholanemia. Although asymptomatic, all individuals had low vitamin D levels. Of six adults that were subjected to bone mineral density analysis, three presented with osteoporosis/osteopenia. Sex hormones and blood lipids were deviated in all subjects. Homozygosity of p. Ser267Phe in SLC10A1 is associated with asymptomatic hypercholanemia. Individuals with homozygous p. Ser267Phe in SLC10A1 are prone to vitamin D deficiency, deviated sex hormones and blood lipids. Surveillance of these parameters may also be needed in patients treated with drugs targeting NTCP.

We have previously established a risk classification system based on DNA copy number profiles. To further explore the pathogenesis of NBs in distinct risk groups, we performed whole-exome sequencing analysis of 57 primary and 7 recurrent/metastatic tumors with unique chromosomal aberration profiles as categorized by our genomic sub-grouping system. Overall, a low frequency of somatic mutations was found. Besides ALK (4/64, 6.3%), SEMA6C, SLIT1 and NRAS, genes involved in the axon guidance pathway, were identified as recurrently mutated in 6 of 64 tumors (9.4%). Pathway enrichment analysis revealed enrichment of 25 mutated genes in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, 13 genes in the Wnt pathway, and 12 genes in the axon guidance pathway. Genomic analyses demonstrated that primary and matched recurrent or metastatic tumors obtained from sporadic and monozygotic twin NBs were clonally related with variable extents of genetic heterogeneity. Monozygotic twin NBs displayed different evolutionary trajectories. These results indicate the involvement of the axon guidance, MAPK and Wnt pathways in NB and demonstrate genomic diversity with NB progression.

We sequenced the complete genome of A02 using next-generation sequencing platforms, and to achieve better sequence coverage and genome assembly, we utilized single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing. The assembled genome comprises a 9,307,519-bp linear chromosome with a GC content of 70.67%, and contained 8,888 predicted genes. Comparative genomics and natamycin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) analysis showed that BGC are highly conserved among evolutionarily diverse strains, and they also shared closer genome evolution compared with other Streptomyces species. Forty gene clusters were predicted to involve in the secondary metabolism of A02, and it was richly displayed in two-component signal transduction systems (TCS) in the genome, indicating a complex regulatory systems and high diversity of metabolites. Disruption of the phoP gene of the phoR-phoP TCS and nsdA gene confirmed phosphate sensitivity and global negative regulation of natamycin production.

It is prone to drought stress in the arid and semi-arid areas where it is widely grown. This study aims to decipher the response of tolerant (DT) and sensitive (DS) genotypes to progressive drought based on transcriptome, biochemical and physio-anatomical characterizations. Results indicated that under severe stress, DT relied on a well-functioning taproot while DS displayed a disintegrated root due to collapsed cortical cells. This was attributed to a higher accumulation of osmoprotectants and strong activity of antioxidant enzymes especially peroxidases in DT. From roots, DT could supply water to the aboveground tissues to ensure photosynthetic activities and improve endurance under stress. Temporal transcriptome sequencing under drought further confirmed that DT strongly activated genes related to antioxidant activity, osmoprotection and hormonal signaling pathways including abscisic acid and Ethylene. Furthermore, DT displayed unique differentially expressed genes in root functioning as peroxidases, interleukin receptor-associated kinase, heat shock proteins, APETALA2/ethylene-responsive element-binding protein and mitogen activated protein kinase, to effectively scavenge reactive oxygen species and preserve root cell integrity. Finally, 61 candidate genes conferring higher drought tolerance in DT were discovered and may constitute useful resources for drought tolerance improvement in sesame.

In this study, we propose to design an animal SNP chip using the SHS-based target enrichment strategy for the first time. As an update to the international collaboration on goat research, a 66 K SNP chip for cashmere goat was created from the whole-genome sequencing data of 73 individuals. Verification of this 66 K SNP chip with the whole-genome sequencing data of 436 cashmere goats showed that the SNP call rates was between 95.3% and 99.8%. The average sequencing depth for target SNPs were 40X. The capture regions were shown to be 200 bp that flank target SNPs. This chip was further tested in a genome-wide association analysis of cashmere fineness (fiber diameter). Several top hit loci were found marginally associated with signaling pathways involved in hair growth. These results demonstrate that the 66 K SNP chip is a useful tool in the genomic analyses of cashmere goats. The successful chip design shows that the SHS-based target enrichment strategy could be applied to SNP chip design in other species.

In recent years, high-throughput sequencing based immune repertoire sequencing (IR-SEQ) has become a powerful tool to study the dynamic adaptive immune responses. Several previous studies had analyzed the responses of B cells to HIV-1 trimer vaccine or T cell repertoire of rhesus macaques using this technique, however, there are little studies that had performed a comprehensive analysis of immune repertoire of rhesus macaques, including T and B lymphocytes. Here, we did a comprehensive analysis of the T and B cells receptor repertoires of a Chinese rhesus macaque based on the 5'-RACE and IR-SEQ. The detailed analysis includes the distribution of CDR3 length, the composition of amino acids and nucleotides of CDR3, V, J and V-J combination usage, the insertion and deletion length distribution and somatic hypermutation rates of the framework region 3 (FR3). In addition, we found that several positions of FR3 region have high mutation frequencies, which may indicate the existence of new genes/alleles that have not been discovered and/or collected into IMGT reference database. We believe that a comprehensive profiling of immune repertoire of rhesus macaque will facilitate the human immune-related diseases studies.

The SNP-set based association study identifies ITGA1 as a susceptibility gene of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in Han Chinese	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; MOLECULAR-GENETICS; VARIANTS; AUTISM; ADHD; RARE; METAANALYSIS; CHROMOSOME; MUTATIONS	Genome-wide association studies, which detect the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and disease susceptibility, have been extensively applied to study attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but genome-wide significant associations have not been found yet. Genetic heterogeneity and insufficient genomic coverage may account for the missing heritability. We performed a two-stage association study for ADHD in the Han Chinese population. In the discovery stage, 1033 ADHD patients and 950 healthy controls were genotyped using both the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 and the Illumina Infinium HumanExome BeadChip. The genotyped SNPs were combined to generate a powerful SNP set with better genomic coverage especially for the nonsynonymous variants. In addition to the association of single SNPs, we collected adjacent SNPs as SNP sets, which were determined by either genes or successive sliding windows, to evaluate their synergetic effect. The candidate susceptibility SNPs were further replicated in an independent cohort of 1441 ADHD patients and 1447 healthy controls. No genome-wide significant SNPs or gene-based SNP sets were found to be associated with ADHD. However, two continuous sliding windows located in ITGA1 (P-value = 8.33E - 7 and P-value = 8.43E - 7) were genome-wide significant. The quantitative trait analyses also demonstrated their association with ADHD core symptoms and executive functions. The association was further validated by follow-up replications for four selected SNPs: rs1979398 (P-value = 2.64E - 6), rs16880453 (P-value = 3.58E - 4), rs1531545 (P-value = 7.62E - 4) and rs4074793 (P-value = 2.03E - 4). Our results suggest that genetic variants in ITGA1 may be involved in the etiology of ADHD and the SNP-set based analysis is a promising strategy for the detection of underlying genetic risk factors.

Noninvasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) of 21-OHD was based on 14 plasma samples collected from 12 families, including four plasma sample collected during the first trimester. Targeted capture sequencing was performed using genomic DNA from the parents and child trios to determine the pathogenic and wild-type alleles associated with the haplotypes. Maternal plasma DNA was also sequenced to determine the fetal inheritance of the allele using hidden Markov model-based haplotype linkage analysis. The effect of fetal DNA fraction and sequencing depth on the accuracy of NIPD was investigated. The lower limit of fetal DNA fraction was 2% and the threshold mean sequence depth was 38, suggesting potential advantage if used in early gestation. The CYP21A2 genotype of the fetus was accurately determined in all the 14 plasma samples as early as day 1 and 8 weeks of gestation. Results suggest the accuracy and feasibility of NIPD of 21-OHD using a small target capture region with a low threshold for fetal DNA fraction and sequence depth. Our method is cost-effective and suggests diagnostic applications in clinical practice.

Until recently, when the genomes of two coral-symbiotic dinoflagellate genomes, Symbiodinium kawagutii and S. minutum, were released, it has not been possible to systematically study these retrogenes. Here we examine the abundant retrogenes (similar to 23% of the total genes) in these species. The hallmark of retrogenes in the genome is the presence of DCCGTAGCCATTTTGGCTCAAG, a spliced leader (DinoSL) constitutively trans-spliced to the 5'-end of all nucleus-encodedmRNAs. Although the retrogenes have often lost part of the 22-nt DinoSL, the putative promoter motif from the DinoSL, TTT(T/G), is consistently retained in the upstream region of these genes, providing an explanation for the high survival rate of retrogenes in dinoflagellates. Our analysis of DinoSL sequence divergence revealed two major bursts of retroposition in the evolutionary history of Symbiodinium, occurringat similar to 60 and similar to 6Ma. Reconstruction of the evolutionary trajectory of the Symbiodinium genomes mapped these 2 times to the origin and rapid radiation of this dinoflagellate lineage, respectively. GO analysis revealed differential functional enrichment of the retrogenes between the two episodes, with a broad impact on transport in the first bout and more localized influence on symbiosis-related processes such as cell adhesion in the second bout. This study provides the first evidence of large-scale retroposition as a major mechanism of genome evolution for any organism and sheds light on evolution of coral symbiosis.

This study aimed to assess the contribution of gut microbiota dysbiosis to the pathogenesis of NAFLD. METHODS: Forty-seven human feces samples (25 NAFLD patients and 22 healthy subjects) were collected and 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing was conducted on Hiseq 2000 platform. Discrepancy of species composition between controls and NAFLD group was defined by Metastats analysis under P value <0.01. RESULTS: NAFLD patients harbored lower gut microbiota diversity than healthy subjects did. In comparison to the control group, the Proteobacteria (13.50%) and Fusobacteria (2.76%) phyla were more abundant in NAFLD patients. Additionally, the Lachnospiraceae (21.90%), Enterobacteriaceae (12.02%), Erysipelotrichaceae (3.83%), and Streptococcaceae (1.39%) families, as well as the Escherichia_Shigella (10.84%), Lachnospiraceae_Incertae_Sedis (7.79%), and Blautia (4.95%) genera were enriched in the NAFLD group. However, there was a lower abundance of Prevotella in the NAFLD group than that in the control group (5.83% vs 27.56%, P<0.01). The phylum Bacteroidetes (44.63%) also tended to be more abundant in healthy subjects, and the families Prevotellaceae (28.66%) and Ruminococcaceae (26.44%) followed the same trend. Compared to those without non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), patients with NASH had higher abundance of genus Blautia (5.82% vs 2.25%; P=0.01) and the corresponding Lachnospiraceae family (24.33% vs 14.21%; P<0.01). Patients with significant fibrosis had a higher abundance of genus Escherichia_Shigella (12.53% vs 1.97%; P<0.01) and the corresponding Enterobacteriaceae family (13.92% vs 2.07%; P<0.01) compared to those with F0/F1 fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: NAFLD patients and healthy subjects harbor varying gut microbiota. In contrast to the results of previous research on children, decreased levels of Prevotella might be detrimental for adults with NAFLD. The increased level of the genus Blautia, the family Lachnospiraceae, the genus Escherichia_Shigella, and the family Enterobacteriaceae may be a primary contributor to NAFLD progression.

To explore the underlying clonal diversity in lung adenocarcinomas, we selected nine individuals with whole-genome sequencing data from primary and matched metastatic tumors as a cohort for study. Similar global pattern of arm-level copy number changes and large variations of somatic single-nucleotide variant between the primary and metastasis are observed in the majority of cases. Importantly, we found breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycles acting as an important mechanism for underlying cancer gene amplification, such as amplification of CDK4, CDKN3 and FGFR1 in early stage. We also identified recurrent focal amplification of gene CCNY derived from BFB in two metastatic tumors, but not in primary tumor. Clonal analysis of case 236T demonstrated that mutational processes are varying with tumor progression. Collectively, our data provide new insights into genetic diversity and potential therapeutic target in lung adenocarcinoma.

However, the best conditions for stable and reliable storage and transport of these samples at room temperature are still unknown, and whether samples stored at room temperature for several days will maintain their microbiota composition is still unknown. Here, we established and tested a preservation method using reagents containing imidazolium- or pyridinium-based ionic liquids. We stored human fecal samples in these reagents for up to 7 days at different temperatures. Subsequently, all samples were sequenced and compared with fresh samples and/or samples treated under other conditions. The 16S rRNA sequencing results suggested that ionic liquid-based reagents could stabilize the composition of the microbiota in fecal samples during a 7-day storage period, particularly when stored at room temperature. Thus, this method may have implications in the storage of fecal samples for metagenomic research.

Although the exact cause of PDB is still controversial, genetic factors are considered to play an important role in PDB. Several genes involved in the differentiation or function of osteoclast were shown to be associated with PDB or related syndrome such as SQSTM1, TNFRSF11A, TNFRSF11B, and ZNF687. Multisystem proteinopathy (MSP), a newly proposed syndrome including inclusion body myopathy (IBM), PDB, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is mainly caused by mutation in VCP gene. In 2013, a new casual gene for MSP was identified as hnRNPA2B1 gene. This may partly account for the inherited PDB traits which is however negative for mutation in already known causative PDB genes. We investigated a Chinese family with multiple affected individuals with PDB, but none of the members showed symptoms of IBM, FTD, or ALS. Three patients were evaluated clinically, biochemically, and radiographically. To screen for the responsible mutation, whole-exome sequencing was conducted in the proband, another patient, as well as a normal individual from the family. This revealed a novel heterozygous missense mutation of hnRNPA2B1 gene (c.929C > T, p. P310L) in the two patients which was then verified in all affected individuals. We describe here a novel missense mutation in hnRNPA2B1 gene in a large pedigree affected with PDB with members who do not present other manifestations of multisystem proteinopathy, such as IBM, FTD, and ALS.

However, the focus of previous studies has primarily been on low-coverage data due to the high cost of sequencing. Although the 1000 Genomes Project and the Haplotype Reference Consortium have both provided powerful reference panels for imputation, low-frequency and novel variants remain difficult to discover and call with accuracy on the basis of low-coverage data. Deep sequencing provides an optimal solution for the problem of these low-frequency and novel variants. Although whole-exome sequencing is also a viable choice for exome regions, it cannot account for noncoding regions, sometimes resulting in the absence of important, causal variants. For Han Chinese populations, the majority of variants have been discovered based upon low-coverage data from the 1000 Genomes Project. However, high-coverage, whole-genome sequencing data are limited for any population, and a large amount of low-frequency, population-specific variants remain uncharacterized. We have performed whole-genome sequencing at a high depth (similar to x80) of 90 unrelated individuals of Chinese ancestry, collected from the 1000 Genomes Project samples, including 45 Northern Han Chinese and 45 Southern Han Chinese samples. Eighty-three of these 90 have been sequenced by the 1000 Genomes Project. We have identified 12 568 804 single nucleotide polymorphisms, 2 074 210 short InDels, and 26 142 structural variations from these 90 samples. Compared to the Han Chinese data from the 1000 Genomes Project, we have found 7 000 629 novel variants with low frequency (defined as minor allele frequency < 5%), including 5 813 503 single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1 169 199 InDels, and 17 927 structural variants. Using deep sequencing data, we have built a greatly expanded spectrum of genetic variationfor the Han Chinese genome. Compared to the 1000 Genomes Project, these Han Chinese deep sequencing data enhance the characterization of a large number of low- frequency, novel variants. This will be a valuable resource for promoting Chinese genetics research and medical development. Additionally, it will provide a valuable supplement to the 1000 Genomes Project, as well as to other human genome projects.

However, studies of human retrotransposon insertion polymorphisms (RIPs) based on whole-genome deep sequencing at the population level have not been sufficiently undertaken, despite the obvious need for a thorough characterization of RIPs in the general population. Herein, we present a novel and efficient computational tool called Specific Insertions Detector (SID) for the detection of non-reference RIPs. We demonstrate that SID is suitable for high-depth whole-genome sequencing data using paired-end reads obtained from simulated and real datasets. We construct a comprehensive RIP database using a large population of 90 Han Chinese individuals with a mean x68 depth per individual. In total, we identify 9342 recent RIPs, and 8433 of these RIPs are novel compared with dbRIP, including 5826 Alu, 2169 long interspersed nuclear element 1 (L1), 383 SVA, and 55 long terminal repeats. Among the 9342 RIPs, 4828 were located in gene regions and 5 were located in protein-coding regions. We demonstrate that RIPs can, in principle, be an informative resource to perform population evolution and phylogeneticanalyses. Taking the demographic effects into account, we identify a weak negative selection on SVA and L1 but an approximately neutral selection for Alu elements based on the frequency spectrum of RIPs. SID is a powerful open-source program for the detection of non-reference RIPs. We built a non-reference RIP dataset that greatly enhanced the diversity of RIPs detected in the general population, and it should be invaluable to researchers interested in many aspects of human evolution, genetics, and disease. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that the RIPs can be used as biomarkers in a similar way as single nucleotide polymorphisms.

Here, we compared the gut microbial composition of 43 GDM patients and 81 healthy pregnant women via whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing of their fecal samples collected at 21-29 weeks, explore associations between GDM and the composition of microbial taxonomic units and functional genes. Results Metagenome-wide association study (MGWAS) identified 154,837 genes, which clustered 129 metagenome linkage groups (MLGs) for species description, with significant relative abundance differences between the two cohorts. Parabacteroides distasonis, Klebsiella variicola, etc., were enriched in GDM patients, whereas Methanobrevibacter smithii, Alistipes spp., Bifidobacterium spp. and Eubacterium spp. were enriched in controls. The ratios of the gross abundances of GDM-enriched MLGs to control-enriched MLGs were positively correlated with blood glucose levels. Random Forest model shows fecal MLGs have excellent discriminatory power to predict GDM status. Conclusions Our study discovered novel relationships between gut microbiome and GDM status, and suggested that changes in microbial composition may potentially be used to identify individuals at risk for GDM.

Here, to explore the biological diversity of ESCC, we employed gene expression profiles from 360 ESCC tumors from East Asians to establish a comprehensive molecular classification and characterization of ESCC. Using the specific 185-gene signature generated by unsupervised consensus clustering of gene expression data, we defined four subtypes associated with distinct clinical metrics: tumors with high metastasis associated with EMT (epithelial to mesenchymal transition) and active MAP4K4/JNK signaling pathway; tumors with high chromosomal instability with up regulated MYC targes; well differentiated tumors with less aggressive and moderated tumors. The clinical relevance of these subtypes was stated by significant differences in prognosis. Importantly, 24% of all ESCCs (n = 360) were classified into the high metastasis subtype associated with poorly differentiation and unfavorable prognosis. We provided evidence that this subtype relates to tumor microenvironment. Collectively, these results might contribute to more precise personalized therapeutic strategies for each subtype of ESCC patients in the near future.

Herein, we reported the first case of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and bacteremia due to Exiguobacterium spp. in China. Case presentation: An adult male with severe CAP was hospitalized. The pathogen was isolated from his bloodstream and broncho-alveolar lavage fluid. The correct identification of the micro-organism was achieved using 16S rRNA sequencing, and its antibiotic susceptibility test was performed by microdilution method. The Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) was used to characterize its genetic features and to elucidate its potential pathogenic mechanisms. Furthermore, its genome sequence was also compared with those of 3 publicly-available Exiguobacterium strains. A PubMed search was performed for further understanding the features of Exiguobacterium infections. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that the strain GX59 was most closely related to Exiguobacterium AT1b (99.7%). The genome of GX59 was 2,727,929 bp in size, harbouring 2855 putative protein-coding genes, 5 rRNA operons, 37 tRNA genes and 1 tmRNA. The multiple genome comparison of 4 Exiguobacterium strains demonstrated that Exiguobacterium contained 37 genes of secretion systems, including sec, tat, FEA, Type IV Pili and competence-related DNA transformation transporter (Com). Virulence factors of the micro-organism included tlyC, NprR, MCP, Dam, which might play a critical role in causing lethal infection. Conclusions: The study highlighted the potential pathogenicity of the genus Exiguobacterium for its unique genes encoding various virulence factors and those associated with antibiotic resistance, therefore, its clinical significance should be valued.

This syndrome is characterized by childhood retinal degeneration; sensorineural hearing loss; obesity; type 2 diabetes mellitus; cardiomyopathy; systemic fibrosis; and pulmonary, hepatic, and renal failure. Case presentation: A Chinese quartet family with two siblings predominantly affected by cone-rod dystrophy and short stature were recruited. The craniofacial dysmorphism and on-set age-of-cone-rod dystrophy in the proband showed a minor intrafamilial variability. Whole genome sequencing was performed to provide the full spectrum of the two siblings' genetic variations. In this study, we present the patients' clinical features and our interpretation of the whole genome sequencing data. After examining the data, we focus on two compound heterozygous mutations, (c. 3902C > A, p. S1301X; c. 6436C > T, p. R2146X) in ALMS1, which are shared by two siblings. Conclusion: We reported a novel ALMS1 mutation. Whole genome sequencing is a powerful tool to provide the full spectrum of genetic variations for heterogeneous disorders such as Alstrom syndrome.

Thomas P.			An expanded mammal mitogenome dataset from Southeast Asia	GIGASCIENCE			English	Article						invertebrate-derived (iDNA); metabarcoding; GenBank; Taxonomic assignment	SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; DNA; LEECHES; ANCIENT; GENOMES; TOOL	Background: Southeast (SE) Asia is one of the most biodiverse regions in the world and it holds approximately 20% of all mammal species. Despite this, the majority of SE Asia's genetic diversity is still poorly characterised. The growing interest in using environmental DNA (eDNA) to assess and monitor SE Asian species, in particular threatened mammals - has created the urgent need to expand the available reference database of mitochondrial barcode and complete mitogenome sequences. We have partially addressed this need by generating 72 new mitogenome sequences reconstructed from DNA isolated from a range of historical and modern tissue samples. Findings: Approximately 55 gigabases of raw sequence were generated. From this data we assembled 72 complete mitogenome sequences, with an average depth of coverage of 102.9x and 55.2x for modern samples and historical samples, respectively. This dataset represents 52 species, of which 30 species had no previous mitogenome data available. The mitogenomes were geotagged to their sampling location, where known, to display a detailed geographical distribution of the species. Conclusion: Our new database of 52 taxa will strongly enhance the utility of eDNA approaches for monitoring mammals in SE Asia, as it greatly increases the likelihoods that identification of metabarcoding sequencing reads can be assigned to reference sequences. This magnifies the confidence in species detections and thus allows more robust surveys and monitoring programmes of SE Asia's threatened mammal biodiversity. The extensive collections of historical samples from SE Asia in western and SE Asian museums should serve as additional valuable material to further enrich this reference database.

However, these loci may be biased and suffer from reduced sensitivities toward specific population groups. In addition, the rapid growth of entries in forensic databases raises the chance of random hits, which can cause false recognitions of criminal suspects. A solution to these problems is to introduce more effective STR markers. The availability of whole genome sequencing enables us to identify more reliable STR markers for forensic applications computationally. In this paper, we proposed an algorithm to identify STR markers with high discriminative abilities from the next-generation sequencing data. Our algorithm could select a customized set of loci for a given population with prespecified discriminative thresholds. We have applied the method to 320 Chinese individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project and obtained various numbers of loci, which were able to statistically identify an individual worldwide and had higher combined powers of discrimination and combined probabilities of exclusion than the existing CODIS 13 loci. For identity testing, the mean frequency of DNA profile (FDP) with the selected 11 STRs was smaller than that with CODIS 13 STRs by student's t-test. With more loci, much smaller FDPs were obtained. The database matching probabilities for selected loci were also lower than that for CODIS 13 STRs in a database with 10 billion entries. Moreover, the selected loci were able to provide considerably low chance of random profile matches so that statistically no false positives could occur. The selected loci also reduced the risk of random allele matches when doing the familial search, with lower random allele matching probabilities. In addition, the selected STRs were statistically better than CODIS STRs for paternity testing in our simulated data, with lower probabilities of false inclusions and exclusions.

As a representative vermivorous cone snail, the Chinese tubular cone snail (Conus betulinus) is the dominant Conus species inhabiting the South China Sea. We sequenced related venom transcriptomes from C. betulinus using both the next-generation sequencing and traditional Sanger sequencing technologies, and a comprehensive library of 215 conotoxin transcripts was constructed. In our current study, six conotoxins with potential insecticidal activity were screened out from our conotoxin library by homologous search with a reported positive control (alpha-conotoxin ImI from C. imperialis) as the query. Subsequently, these conotoxins were synthesized by chemical solid-phase and oxidative folding for further insecticidal activity validation, such as MTT assay, insect bioassay and homology modeling. The final results proved insecticidal activities of our achieved six conotoxins from the transcriptome-based dataset. Interestingly, two of them presented a lot of high insecticidal activity, which supports their usefulness for a trial as insecticides in field investigations. In summary, our present work provides a good example for high throughput development of biological insecticides on basis of the accumulated genomic resources.

Recently we reported a high-throughput method to identify 215 conotoxin transcripts from the Chinese tubular cone snail, C. betulinus. Here, based on the previous datasets of four transcriptomes from three venom ducts and one venom bulb, we explored ion channel-based conotoxins and predicted their related ion channel receptors. Homologous analysis was also performed for the most abundant ion channel protein, voltage-gated potassium (Kv; with Kv1.1 as the representative), and the most studied ion channel receptor, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR; with alpha 2-nAChR as the representative), in different animals. Our transcriptomic survey demonstrated that ion channel-based conotoxins and related ion channel proteins/receptors transcribe differentially between the venom duct and the venom bulb. In addition, we observed that putative kappa-conotoxins were the most common conotoxins with the highest transcription levels in the examined C. betulinus. Furthermore, Kv1.1 and alpha 2-nAChR were conserved in their functional domains of deduced protein sequences, suggesting similar effects of conotoxins via the ion channels in various species, including human beings. In a word, our present work suggests a high-throughput way to develop conotoxins as potential drugs for treatment of ion channel-associated human diseases.

In south China, similar to 24% of Chinese carry alpha-thalassemia or beta-thalassemia gene mutations. Given the fact that invasive sampling procedures can only be performed by professionals in experienced centers, it may increase the risk of miscarriage or infection. Thus, most people are worried about invasive prenatal testing. As such, a noninvasive and accurate prenatal diagnosis is needed for appropriate genetic counseling for families with high risks. Here we sought to develop capture probes and their companion analysis methods for the noninvasive prenatal detection of deletional and non-deletional thalassemia. Materials and Methods: Two families diagnosed as carriers of either the beta-thalassemia gene or the Southeast Asian deletional alpha-thalassemia gene mutation were recruited. Maternal plasma and amniotic fluid were collected for prenatal diagnosis. Probes targeting exons of the genes of interest and the highly heterozygous SNPs within the 1Mb flanking region were designed. The target capture sequencing was performed with plasma DNA from the pregnant woman and genomic DNA from the couples and their children. Then the parental haplotype was constructed by the trios-based strategy. The fetal haplotype was deduced from the parental haplotype with a hidden Markov model-based algorithm. Results: The fetal genotypes were successfully deduced in both families noninvasively. The noninvasively constructed haplotypes of both fetuses were identical to the invasive prenatal diagnosis results with an accuracy rate of 100% in the target region. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that effective noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of alpha-thalassemia and beta-thalassemia can be achieved with the targeted capture sequencing and haplotype-assisted analysis method.

Syndactyly type I-c is associated with bilateral cutaneous or bony webbing of the third and fourth fingers and occasionally of the third to fifth fingers, with normal feet. The aim of the present study was to identify the genetic basis of syndactyly type I-c in four generations of a Chinese Han family by exome sequencing. Exome sequencing was conducted in the proband of the family, followed by direct sequencing of other family members of the same ancestry, as well as 100 ethnically-matched, unrelated normal controls. A missense mutation, c.917G>A (p.R306Q), was identified in the homeobox D13 gene (HOXD13). Sanger sequencing verified the presence of this mutation in all of the affected family members. By contrast, this mutation was absent in the unaffected family members and the 100 ethnically-matched normal controls. The results suggest that the c.917G>A (p.R306Q) mutation in the HOXD13 gene, may be responsible for syndactyly type I-c in this family. Exome sequencing may therefore be a powerful tool for identifying mutations associated with syndactyly, which is a disorder with high genetic and clinical heterogeneity. The results provide novel insights into the etiology and diagnosis of syndactyly, and may influence genetic counseling and the clinical management of the disease.

Porcine skin architecture and immunity are very similar to that in humans, rendering the pig a suitable animal model for studying the biology and treatment of psoriasis. Expression of integrins, which is normally confined to the basal layer of the epidermis, is maintained in suprabasal keratinocytes in psoriatic skin, modulating proliferation and differentiation as well as leukocyte infiltration. Here, we generated minipigs co-expressing integrins alpha 2 and beta 1 in suprabasal epidermal layers. Integrin-transgenic minipigs born into the project displayed skin phenotypes that correlated with the number of inserted transgenes. Molecular analyses were in good concordance with histological observations of psoriatic hallmarks, including hypogranulosis and T-lymphocyte infiltration. These findings mark the first creation of minipigs with a psoriasiform phenotype resembling human psoriasis and demonstrate that integrin signaling plays a key role in psoriasis pathology.

We aimed to evaluate phenotypic changes and molecular events in response to cathepsin D knockdown. Lowering endogenous cathepsin D abundance (CR) induced senescence in HeLa cells, leading to reduced rate of cell proliferation and impaired tumorigenesis in a mouse model. Quantitative proteomics revealed that compared with control cells (EV), the abundances of several typical lysosomal proteases were decreased in the lysosomal fraction in CR cells. We further showed that cathepsin D knockdown caused increased permeability of lysosomal membrane and reactive oxygen species accumulation in CR cells, and the scavenging of reactive oxygen species by antioxidant was able to rescue cell senescence. Despite the increased reactive oxygen species, the proteomic data suggested a global reduction of redox-related proteins in CR cells. Subsequent analysis indicated that the transcriptional activity of nuclear factor erythroid-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which regulates the expression of groups of antioxidant enzymes, was down-regulated by cathepsin D knockdown. Importantly, Nrf2 overexpression significantly reduced cell senescence. Although transient oxidative stress promoted the accumulation of Nrf2 in the nucleus, we showed that the Nrf2 protein exited nucleus if oxidative stress persisted. In addition, when cathepsin D was transiently knocked down, the cathepsin-related events followed a sequential order, including lysosomal leakage during the early stage, followed by oxidative stress augmentation, and ultimately Nrf2 down-regulation and senescence. Our results suggest the roles of cathepsin D in cancer cells in maintaining lysosomal integrity, redox balance, and Nrf2 activity, thus promoting tumorigenesis.

Exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing were performed on a six-generation consanguineous Han Chinese family, members of which had autosomal recessive MDDG. Compound heterozygous mutations, c.1338+1G>A (p.H415Kfs*3) and c.1457G>C (p.W486S, rs746849558), in the protein O-mannosyltransferase 1 gene (POMT1), were identified as the genetic cause. Patients that exhibited milder MDDG manifested as later-onset progressive proximal pelvic, shoulder girdle and limb muscle weakness, joint contractures, mental retardation and elevated creatine kinase, without structural brain or ocular abnormalities, were further genetically diagnosed as MDDGC1. The POMT1 gene splice-site mutation (c.1338+1G>A) which leads to exon 13 skipping and results in a truncated protein may contribute to a severe phenotype, while the allelic missense mutation (p.W486S) may reduce MDDG severity. These findings may expand phenotype and mutation spectrum of the POMT1 gene. Clinical diagnosis supplemented with molecular screening may result in more accurate diagnoses of, prognoses for, and improved genetic counselling for this disease.

Here, we report a patient with hypocalcemia-induced seizures leading to the diagnosis of primary hypoparathyroidism. Mutations in CASR, GCM2, and PTH were ruled out, while whole exome sequencing of the family suggested FHL1, located on chromosome Xq26, as the most likely causative gene variant (FHL1, exon 4, c.C283T, p.R95W). Since FHL1 has not been linked to calcium regulation before, we provide evidence for its functional role in hypoparathyroidism by: (i) bioinformatics analysis coupling its action to known modulators of PTH function; (ii) observing strong expression of fhl1b in Corpuscles of Stannius, gland-like aggregates in zebrafish that function in calcium regulation similar to mammalian PTH; and (iii) implicating fhl1b and FHL1 as regulators of calcium homeostasis in zebrafish and human cells, respectively. Altogether, our data suggest that FHL1 is a novel regulator of calcium homeostasis and implicate it as the causative gene for X-linked recessive hypoparathyroidism.

Comparative performance of the BGISEQ-500 vs Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencing platforms for palaeogenomic sequencing	GIGASCIENCE			English	Article						ancient DNA; BGISEQ-500; Illumina HiSeq 2500; comparative performance	GENOME SEQUENCE; ANCIENT DNA; YERSINIA-PESTIS; MITOCHONDRIAL GENOME; NEANDERTHAL GENOME; WOOLLY MAMMOTH; DAMAGED DNA; EVOLUTION; ENRICHMENT; METHYLATION	Ancient DNA research has been revolutionized following development of next-generation sequencing platforms. Although a number of such platforms have been applied to ancient DNA samples, the Illumina series are the dominant choice today, mainly because of high production capacities and short read production. Recently a potentially attractive alternative platform for palaeogenomic data generation has been developed, the BGISEQ-500, whose sequence output are comparable with the Illumina series. In this study, we modified the standard BGISEQ-500 library preparation specifically for use on degraded DNA, then directly compared the sequencing performance and data quality of the BGISEQ-500 to the Illumina HiSeq2500 platform on DNA extracted from 8 historic and ancient dog and wolf samples. The data generated were largely comparable between sequencing platforms, with no statistically significant difference observed for parameters including level (P = 0.371) and average sequence length (P = 0718) of endogenous nuclear DNA, sequence GC content (P = 0.311), double-stranded DNA damage rate (v. 0.309), and sequence clonality (P = 0.093). Small significant differences were found in single-strand DNA damage rate (delta S; slightly lower for the BGISEQ-500, P = 0.011) and the background rate of difference from the reference genome (theta; slightly higher for BGISEQ-500, P = 0.012). This may result from the differences in amplification cycles used to polymerase chain reaction-amplify the libraries. A significant difference was also observed in the mitochondrial DNA percentages recovered (P = 0.018), although we believe this is likely a stochastic effect relating to the extremely low levels of mitochondria that were sequenced from 3 of the samples with overall very low levels of endogenous DNA. Although we acknowledge that our analyses were limited to animal material, our observations suggest that the BGISEQ-500 holds the potential to represent a valid and potentially valuable alternative platform for palaeogenomic data generation that is worthy of future exploration by those interested in the sequencing and analysis of degraded DNA.

The diversity of mutations and phenotypic heterogeneity of MFS make prenatal molecular diagnoses difficult. In this study, we used preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) to identify the pathogenic mutation in a male patient with MFS and to determine whether his offspring would be free of the disease. Material/Methods: The history and pedigree of the proband were analyzed. Mutation analysis was performed on the couple and immediate family members. The couple chose IVF treatment and 4 blastocysts were biopsied. PGD was carried out by targeted high-throughput sequencing of the FBN1 gene in the embryos, along with single-nucleotide polymorphism haplotyping. Sanger sequencing was used to confirm the causative mutation. Results: c.2647T>C (p. Trp883Arg) was identified as the de novo likely pathogenic mutation in the proband. Whole-genome amplification and sequencing of the 3 embryos revealed that they did not carry the mutation, and 1 blastocyst was transferred back to the uterus. The amniocentesis test result analyzed by Sanger sequencing confirmed the PGD. A premature but healthy infant free of heart malformations was born. Conclusions: The de novo mutation c.2647T>C (p. Trp883Arg) in FBN1 was identified in a Chinese patient with MFS. Embryos without the mutation were identified by PGD and resulted in a successful pregnancy.

Bitter gourd (Momordica charantia) is widely cultivated as a vegetable and medicinal herb in many Asian and African countries. After the sequencing of the cucumber (Cucumis sativus), watermelon (Citrullus lanatus), and melon (Cucumis melo) genomes, bitter gourd became the fourth cucurbit species whose whole genome was sequenced. However, a comprehensive analysis of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in bitter gourd, including a comparison with the three aforementioned cucurbit species has not yet been published. Here, we identified a total of 188,091 and 167,160 SSR motifs in the genomes of the bitter gourd lines 'Dali-11' and 'OHB3-1,' respectively. Subsequently, the SSR content, motif lengths, and classified motif types were characterized for the bitter gourd genomes and compared among all the cucurbit genomes. Lastly, a large set of 138,727 unique in silico SSR primer pairs were designed for bitter gourd. Among these, 71 primers were selected, all of which successfully amplified SSRs from the two bitter gourd lines 'Dali-11' and 'K44'. To further examine the utilization of unique SSR primers, 21 SSR markers were used to genotype a collection of 211 bitter gourd lines from all over the world. A model-based clustering method and phylogenetic analysis indicated a clear separation among the geographic groups.

High-density-marker QTL mapping can serve as an effective strategy to identify novel genomic information to facilitate crop improvement. In this study, we genotyped a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population (Zhonghuang 24 x Huaxia 3) using a restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) approach. A high-density soybean genetic map was constructed and used to identify several QTLs that were shown to influence six yield-related and two quality traits. Results: A total of 47,472 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected for the RILs that were integrated into 2639 recombination bin units, with an average distance of 1.00 cM between adjacent markers. Forty seven QTLs for yield-related traits and 13 QTLs for grain quality traits were found to be distributed on 16 chromosomes in the 2 year studies. Among them, 18 QTLs were stable, and were identified in both analyses. Twenty six QTLs were identified for the first time, with a single QTL (qNN19a) in a 56 kb region explaining 32.56% of phenotypic variation, and an additional 10 of these were novel, stable QTLs. Moreover, 8 QTL hotpots on four different chromosomes were identified for the correlated traits. Conclusions: With RAD-sequencing, some novel QTLs and important QTL clusters for both yield-related and quality traits were identified based on a new, high-density bin linkage map. Three predicted genes were selected as candidates that likely have a direct or indirect influence on both yield and quality in soybean. Our findings will be helpful for understanding common genetic control mechanisms of co-localized traits and to select cultivars for further analysis to predictably modulate soybean yield and quality simultaneously.

The ECL bioassay involved the capture of DNA containing 5-hmC, which was chemically modified with a glucose moiety, through hybridization with complimentary 5'-thiol-modified DNA on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) under the catalysis of beta-GT. The dichlorotris (1,10-phenanthroline) ruthenium -assembled GO (Ru(phen)(3)(2+)/GO) composite was coupled to the electrode surface via a bridging agent, and provided excellent ECL signal. The bridging agent used was 3-aminophenylboronic acid (APBA), boronic acid and its derivatives can interact with 1,2-or 1,3-diols (such as glucose) to generate 5-or 6 -membered cyclic boronate esters. The obtained ECL intensity was positively correlated with the concentration of DNA containing 5-hmC, the linear range was from 0.01 pM to 1.00 nM, with a low limit of detection of 3.84 fM. Our results demonstrate that use of enzymatic and chemical modification in combination with highly sensitive ECL is a facile and promising approach for DNA hydroxymethylation analysis.

Germline mutations in NF1 gene are associated with Neurofibromatosis type 1. NF1 gene encodes neurofibromin, a RAS-specific GTPase activating protein. In our study, we present a clinical molecular study of four Chinese probands with NF1 from four unrelated families, showing extreme phenotypic variation with rare phenotype. In family 1, the proband is a 16 months old girl with multiple cafe-au-lait spots throughout her whole body. In family 2, the proband is a 6 months old girl with several cafe-au-lait spots mostly in her trunk and in lower limbs. In family 3, the proband is a 4 months old boy with several cafe-au-lait spots, tibial pseudarthrosis, and chronic iron deficiency anemia. In family 4, the proband is a 14 years old boy with multiple cafe-au-lait spots of variable sizes. Targeted exome capture based next generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing identified a novel mutation and three previously reported mutations in these four probands. These four mutations in NF1 gene were causing disease phenotypes in these four probands and was absent in unaffected family members and in healthy controls. According to the variant interpretation guideline of American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), these four mutations, are classified as "likely pathogenic". Our result expands the mutational spectrum of the NF1 gene associated with neurofibromatosis type1.

It is an obligate semi-aquatic, viviparous, diurnal species restricted to specific portions of mountainous locations in southwestern China and northeastern Vietnam. However, in the past several decades, this species has undergone a rapid decrease in population size due to illegal poaching and habitat disruption, making this unique reptile species endangered and listed in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora Appendix II since 1990. A proposal to uplist it to Appendix I was passed at the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora Seventeenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties in 2016. To promote the conservation of this species, we sequenced the genome of a male Chinese crocodile lizard using a whole-genome shotgun strategy on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. In total, we generated similar to 291 Gb of raw sequencing data (x149 depth) from 13 libraries with insert sizes ranging from 250 bp to 40 kb. After filtering for polymerase chain reaction-duplicated and low-quality reads, similar to 137 Gb of clean data (x70 depth) were obtained for genome assembly. We yielded a draft genome assembly with a total length of 2.24 Gb and an N50 scaffold size of 1.47 Mb. The assembled genome was predicted to contain 20 150 protein-coding genes and up to 1114 Mb (49.6%) of repetitive elements. The genomic resource of the Chinese crocodile lizard will contribute to deciphering the biology of this organism and provides an essential tool for conservation efforts. It also provides a valuable resource for future study of squamate evolution.

Kuntze), is an aluminum (Al) hyperaccumulator and grows well in acid soils. Although Al-induced growth of tea plant has been studied, the proteomic profiles of tea plants in response to Al are unclear. In the present study, the proteomic profiles in tea roots and leaves under Al stress were investigated using iTRAQproteomics approach. In total, 755 and 1059 differentially expressed proteins were identified in tea roots and leaves, respectively. KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the differentially expressed proteins in roots were mainly involved in 11 pathways whereas those from leaves were mainly involved in 9 pathways. Abundance of most protein functions in glycolytic metabolism were enhanced in tea roots, and proteins involved in photosynthesis were stimulated in tea leaves. The protein ferulate-5-hydroxylase (F5H) in lignin biosynthetic pathway was down-regulated in both roots and leaves. Furthermore, antioxidant enzymes (ascorbate peroxidase, catalase and glutathione S-transferase) and citrate synthesis were accumulated in tea roots in response to Al. The results indicated that active photosynthesis and glycolysis as well as increased activities of antioxidant enzymes can be considered as a possible reason for the stimulatory effects of Al on the growth of tea plants. Additionally, the down-regulation of F5H and the binding of Al and phenolic acids may reduce the accumulation of lignin. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

The aim of our study was to assess the ability of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs)-labeled Wharton's Jelly of the human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (WJ-MSCs) to carry the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene to cutaneous injury sites in a murine model. Methods: WJ-MSCs were isolated from a fresh umbilical cord and were genetically transformed to carry the GFP gene using lentiviral vectors with magnetically labeled SPIONs. The SPIONs/GFP-positive WJ-MSCs expressed multipotent cell markers and demonstrated the potential for osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation. Fifteen skin-injured mice were divided into three groups. Group I was treated with WJ-MSCs, group II with SPIONs/GFP-positive WJ-MSCs, and group III with SPIONs/GFP-positive WJ-MSCs exposed to an external magnetic field (EMF). Magnetic resonance imaging and optical molecular imaging were performed, and images were acquired 1, 2, and 7 days after cell injection. Results: The results showed that GFP could be intensively detected around the wound in vivo 24 h after the cells were injected. Furthermore, we observed an accumulation of WJ-MSCs at the wound site, and EMF exposure increased the speed of cell transport. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that SPIONs/ GFP function as cellular probes for monitoring in vivo migration and homing of WJ-MSCs. Moreover, exposure to an EMF can increase the transportation efficiency of SPIONs-labeled WJ-MSCs in vivo. Conclusions: Our findings could lead to the development of a gene carrier system for the treatment of diseases.

As an herbivore, it can be grown by eco-friendly and resource-conserving aquaculture. However, the large number of intermuscular bones in the trunk musculature is adverse to fish meat processing and consumption. As a first towards optimizing this aquatic livestock, we present a 1.116-Gb draft genome of M. amblycephala, with 779.54 Mb anchored on 24 linkage groups. Integrating spatiotemporal transcriptome analyses, we show that intermuscular bone is formed in the more basal teleosts by intramembranous ossification and may be involved in muscle contractibility and coordinating cellular events. Comparative analysis revealed that olfactory receptor genes, especially of the beta type, underwent an extensive expansion in herbivorous cyprinids, whereas the gene for the umami receptor T1R1 was specifically lost in M. amblycephala. The composition of gut microflora, which contributes to the herbivorous adaptation of M. amblycephala, was found to be similar to that of other herbivores. As a valuable resource for the improvement of M. amblycephala livestock, the draft genome sequence offers new insights into the development of intermuscular bone and herbivorous adaptation.

Some of the RP genes are also associated with other retinal diseases, such as LCA (Leber's congenital amaurosis) and CORD (cone-rod dystrophy). Here, in our molecular diagnosis of 99 Chinese RP patients using targeted gene capture sequencing, three probands were found to carry mutations of RPGRIP1, which was known to be associated with pathogenesis of LCA and CORD. By further clinical analysis, two probands were confirmed to be RP patients and one was confirmed to be LCA patient. These novel mutations were co-segregated with the disease phenotype in their families. Our result not only expands the mutational spectrum of the RPGRIP1 gene but also gives supports to clinical diagnosis and molecular treatment of RP patients.

The large sizes of these genes and the absence of mutation hot spots have complicated mutational analysis by routine polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based approaches. Here, in order to design a rapid and effective method for the genetic diagnosis of AS, we developed a strategy by utilizing targeted capture associated with next-generation sequencing (NGS) to analyze COL4A3, COL4A4, and COL4A5 simultaneously in 20 AS patients. All the coding exons and flanking sequences of COL4A3, COL4A4, and COL4A5 from the probands were captured followed by HiSeq 2500 sequencing. Candidate mutations were validated by classic Sanger sequencing and quantitative (q) PCR. Sixteen patients (16/20, 75%) showed X-linked inheritance, and four patients (4/20, 20%) showed autosomal recessive inheritance. None of the individuals had autosomal-dominant AS. Fifteen novel mutations, 6 known mutations, and 2 novel fragment deletions were detected by targeted capture and NGS. Of these novel mutations, 12, 3, and 2 mutations were detected in COL4A5, COL4A4, and COL4A3, respectively. A comparison of the clinical manifestations caused by different types of mutations in COL4A5 suggested that nonsense mutations and glycine substitution by an acidic amino acid are more severe than the other missense mutations. Pathogenic mutations were detected in 20 patients. These novel mutations can expand the genotypic spectrum of AS. Our results demonstrated that targeted capture and NGS technology are effective in the genetic diagnosis of AS.

Although COPD and lung cancer coexist frequently, it is unknown whether lung cancer patients with COPD harbor distinct genomic characteristics compared to those without COPD. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed genomic sequencing data from 272 patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and compared the genetic alterations in LUAD patients with and without COPD. Integrative analysis of whole-genome and exome sequencing data revealed that COPD and non-COPD groups showed high concordance in mutational burden and spectra. Notably, we also found that EGFR mutations were more prevalent in LUAD patients without COPD, whereas mutated LRP1B was more frequently observed in LUAD patients with COPD. In addition, multi-variable analysis with logistic regression demonstrated that mutation of LRP1B was a predictive marker for the presence of COPD in the patients with LUAD. Our analysis demonstrated for the first time the high concordance in genomic alterations between the tumors from LUAD patients with and without COPD. We also identified higher prevalence of LRP1B among the LUAD patients with COPD, which might help understand the underlying mechanisms which link COPD and lung cancer.

We describe a quantitative proteomics project to measure the T2DM serum proteome response to the Xiaoke Pill and Glibenclamide. Methods: Based on a recently conducted 48-week clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy of Glibenclamide (n = 400) and Xiaoke Pill (n = 400), after matching for age, sex, BMI, drug dose and whether hypoglycemia occurred, 32 patients were selected for the serum based proteomic analysis and divided into four groups (with/without hypoglycemia treated with Xiaoke Pill or Glibenclamide, n = 8 for each group). We screened the differential serum proteins related to treatments and the onset of hypoglycemia using the iTRAQ labeling quantitative proteomics technique. Baseline and follow-up samples were used. Results: The quantitative proteomics experiments demonstrated that 25 and 21 proteins differed upon treatment with the Xiaoke Pill in patients without and with hypoglycemia, respectively, while 24 and 25 proteins differed upon treatment with Glibenclamide in patients without and with hypoglycemia, respectively. The overlap of different proteins between the patients with and without hypoglycemia given the same drug treatment was much greater than between the patients given different drug treatments. Conclusions: We conclude that the serum proteins response to the two different anti-diabetic drug treatments may serve as a sensitive biomarker for evaluation of the therapeutic effects and continue investigations into the mechanism.

Liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry was applied to detect the global lipidome in the fasting plasma of 293 Chinese individuals, including 114 T2D patients, 81 prediabetic subjects, and 98 individuals with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). Both qualitative and quantitative analyses revealed a gradual change in plasma lipid features with T2D patients exhibiting characteristics close to those of prediabetic individuals, whereas they differed significantly from individuals with NGT. We constructed and validated a random forest classifier with 28 lipidomic features that effectively discriminated T2D from NGT or prediabetes. Most of the selected features significantly correlated with diabetic clinical indices. Hydroxybutyrylcarnitine was positively correlated with fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour postprandial glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR). Lysophosphatidylcholines such as lysophosphatidylcholine (18:0), lysophosphatidylcholine (18:1), and lysophosphatidylcholine (18:2) were all negatively correlated with HOMA-IR. The altered plasma lipidome in Chinese T2D and prediabetic subjects suggests that lipid features may play a role in the pathogenesis of T2D and that such features may provide a basis for evaluating risk and monitoring disease development.

Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are potential prognostic markers and therapeutic agents for cancer. However, the spatial heterogeneity of the B cell repertoire in intestinal mucosa and the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain poorly understood. In this study, we developed an unbiased method to amplify the IgH repertoire, as well as a bioinformatic pipeline to process these high-throughput sequencing data. With biopsies from seven intestinal mucosal segments, we uncovered their strong spatial homogeneity among the large intestine, where the clone overlap rate was up to 62.21%. The heterogeneity between terminal ileum and large intestine was also observed, including discrepant isotype distribution and low clone overlap rate. With tumor and adjacent normal mucosal tissues from CRC and colorectal advanced adenoma (AD) patients, we observed a similar IgH profile between tumor and adjacent normal mucosal tissues in AD, as well as a slight difference in CRC. Interestingly, we found distinct repertoire properties in the CRC tumor from AD and normal mucosa. Finally, we identified 1445 public clones for the normal mucosa, and 22 public clones for the CRC tumor with characteristic features. These data may be of potential use in clinical prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment of CRC.

Here, we examined how long-term intake of a high-fat/high-sucrose (HF/HS) diet based on safflower oil affected metabolism, inflammation, and gut microbiota composition. Methods and results: We fed male C57BL/6J mice a HF/HS diet based on safflower oil-rich in n-6 PUFAs-or a low-fat/low-sucrose diet for 40 wk. Compared to the low-fat/low-sucrose diet, intake of the safflower-based HF/HS diet only led to moderate weight gain, while glucose intolerance developed at week 5 prior to signs of inflammation, but concurrent with increased levels of linoleic acid and arachidonic acid in hepatic phospholipids. Intake of the HF/HS diet resulted in early changes in the gut microbiota, including an increased abundance of Blautia, while late changes coincided with altered inflammatory profiles and increased fasting plasma insulin. Analysis of immune cells in visceral fat and liver revealed no differences between diets before week 40, where the number of immune cells decreased in the liver of HF/HS-fed mice. Conclusion: We suggest that a diet-dependent increase in the n-6 to omega-3 (n-3) PUFA ratio in hepatic phospholipids together with gut microbiota changes contributed to early development of glucose intolerance without signs of inflammation.

This was a retrospective analysis of NIPT study in singleton pregnancy (n= 1,901). The NIPT test is offered routinely as a prenatal screening test for common fetal aneuploidies, including trisomy 13 (T13), T18 and T21 to pregnant women with risk factors of one or more anomalies. Maternal peripheral blood (5 ml) was collected in an ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tube at a gestational age of 12+ 0 to 32+ 6 weeks. The samples were delivered at -80 degrees C to the certified Shenzhen BGI Clinical Laboratory Center. Sequencing data were analyzed using a proprietary algorithm. Women with positive NIPT results were recommended to receive karyotype analysis and amniotic fluid puncture for further validation. The cases were followed up for 56 days after delivery. All the patients underwent ultrasound examination, and the majority of patients (91.16%) showed normal findings. In contrast, 136 (7.15%) showed ultrasound anomalies. The most common anomaly was echogenic heart focus (n= 80), accounting for 4.21% of the patients. Twenty-two cases were classified by the NIPT to be positive for the T21 (n= 15), T18 (n= 5) and T13 (n= 2), respectively, while the others (n= 1,879) were classified to be NIPT negative cases. Among these cases, the fetal outcome data were obtained in 1,483 cases, while 396 were lost to follow-up. The majority of cases (75.47%) were normal at birth. Neonatal death was observed in 1 case. Five pregnant women decided termination of pregnancy despite the presence of NIPT negativity. In conclusion, NIPT technique is feasible for the prenatal screening of T18 and T21 with higher sensitivity and specificity compared with conventional methods.

Clinical validation of a novel urine-based metabolomic test for the detection of colonic polyps on Chinese population	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COLORECTAL DISEASE			English	Article						Colorectal cancer; Adenomatous polyps; Metabolomics; Urine; PolypDx (TM)	COLORECTAL-CANCER; RISK	Colorectal cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in China. When detected early, with the removal of adenomatous polyps, precursors of colorectal cancer, it is preventable. The aim of this study was to evaluate a novel urine-based metabolomic diagnostic test for the detection of adenomatous polyps, PolypDx (TM), that was originally developed and validated using 1000 samples from Canadian Cohort, on Chinese population. Prospective urine samples were collected from 1000 participants undergoing colonoscopy examination, from March 2013 to July 2014 at Minhang District, Shanghai Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. One-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of urine metabolites were analyzed to determine the concentrations of three key metabolites used in PolypDx (TM). The predicted results were then compared to the gold standard for colorectal cancer diagnostic, colonoscopy. Area under curve (AUC) was calculated specifically for the Chinese population and compared with the Canadian dataset. Sensitivity and specificity of this urine-based metabolomic diagnostic test were also compared with three commercially available fecal-based tests. An AUC of 0.717 for PolypDx (TM) was calculated on Chinese dataset which is slightly lower than the AUC on the Canadian dataset. A sensitivity of 82.6% and a specificity of 42.4% were achieved on Chinese dataset. Here, we validated a novel urine-based metabolomic diagnostic test for the detection of adenomatous polyps, PolypDx (TM), on Chinese population through a sample size of 1000 participants with a greater level of sensitivity than fecal-based tests.

Phytophthora root rot (PRR) caused by Phytophthora sojae is one of the most important soil-borne diseases in many soybean-production regions in the world. Identification of resistant gene(s) and incorporating them into elite varieties are an effective way for breeding to prevent soybean from being harmed by this disease. Two soybean populations of 191 F-2 individuals and 196 F-7:8 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were developed to map Rps gene by crossing a susceptible cultivar Huachun 2 with the resistant cultivar Wayao. Genetic analysis of the F-2 population indicated that PRR resistance in Wayao was controlled by a single dominant gene, temporarily named RpsWY, which was mapped on chromosome 3. A high-density genetic linkage bin map was constructed using 3469 recombination bins of the RILs to explore the candidate genes by the high-throughput genome-wide sequencing. The results of genotypic analysis showed that the RpsWY gene was located in bin 401 between 4466230 and 4502773 bp on chromosome 3 through line 71 and 100 of the RILs. Four predicted genes (Glyma03g04350, Glyma03g04360, Glyma03g04370, and Glyma03g04380) were found at the narrowed region of 36.5 kb in bin 401. These results suggest that the high-throughput genome-wide resequencing is an effective method to fine map PRR candidate genes.

However, it remains unknown whether mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can directly differentiate into advanced male germ cell lineage in the same conditions. Here, we showed rather low efficiency of germ-like cell generation from mouse ESCs in SSC conditions. Interestingly, addition of retinoic acid (RA) into SSC conditions enabled efficient differentiation of mouse ESCs into germ-like cells, as shown by the activation of spermatogenesis-associated genes such as Mvh, Dazl, Prdm14, Stella, Scp1, Scp3, Stra8 and Rec8. In contrast, for cells cultured in control medium, the activation of the above genes barely occurred. In addition, RA with SSC conditions yielded colonies of Acrosin-expressing cells and the positive ratio reached a peak at day 6. Our work thus establishes a simple and cost-efficient approach for male germ like cell differentiation from mouse PSCs and may propose a useful strategy for studying spermatogenesis in vitro.

Gynaephora species (Lepidoptera: Lymantriinae) are endemic to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) and represent an important insect pest of alpine meadows. Here, we present a detailed comparative analysis of the mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) of two Gynaephora species inhabiting different high-elevation environments: G. alpherakii and G. menyuanensis. The results indicated that the general mitogenomic features (genome size, nucleotide composition, codon usage and secondary structures of tRNAs) were well conserved between the two species. All of mitochondrial protein-coding genes were evolving under purifying selection, suggesting that selection constraints may play a role in ensuring adequate energy production. However, a number of substitutions and indels were identified that altered the protein conformations of ATP8 and NAM, which may be the result of adaptive evolution of the two Gynaephora species to different high-elevation environments. Levels of gene expression for nine mitochondrial genes in nine different developmental stages were significantly suppressed in G. alpherakii, which lives at the higher elevation (similar to 4800 m above sea level), suggesting that gene expression patterns could be modulated by atmospheric oxygen content and environmental temperature. These results enhance our understanding of the genetic bases for the adaptive evolution of insects endemic to the QTP. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It has become very popular in China for its wide use in traditional Chinese medicine. In order to improve the aquaculture yield of this valuable fish species, we are trying to develop genomic resources for assistant selection in genetic breeding. Here, we provide whole genome sequencing, assembly, and gene annotation of the lined seahorse, which can enrich genome resource and further application for its molecular breeding. Findings: A total of 174.6 Gb (Gigabase) raw DNA sequences were generated by the Illumina Hiseq2500 platform. The final assembly of the lined seahorse genome is around 458 Mb, representing 94% of the estimated genome size (489 Mb by k-mer analysis). The contig N50 and scaffold N50 reached 14.57 kb and 1.97 Mb, respectively. Quality of the assembled genome was assessed by BUSCO with prediction of 85% of the known vertebrate genes and evaluated using the de novo assembled RNA-seq transcripts to prove a high mapping ratio (more than 99% transcripts could be mapped to the assembly). Using homology-based, de novo and transcriptome-based prediction methods, we predicted 20 788 protein-coding genes in the generated assembly, which is less than our previously reported gene number (23 458) of the tiger tail seahorse (H. comes). Conclusion: We report a draft genome of the lined seahorse. These generated genomic data are going to enrich genome resource of this economically important fish, and also provide insights into the genetic mechanisms of its iconic morphology and male pregnancy behavior.

Here, we report a genome-wide analysis of the MADS-box gene family in Chinese jujube. Based on phylogenetic analyses, 52 jujube MADS-box genes were classified into 25 MIKCC-type, 3 MIKC*-type, 16 M alpha, 5 M beta and 3 M gamma genes. 37 genes were randomly distributed across all 12 putative chromosomes. We found that the type II genes are more complex than the type I genes and that tandem duplications have occurred in three groups of MADS-box genes. Meanwhile, some gene pairs in the same clade displayed similar or distinct expression profiles, suggesting possible functional redundancy or divergence. MIKCC-type genes exhibited typical temporal and spatial expression patterns in the four whorls of floral tissues. The expressions of B,C/D and E-type genes were significantly suppressed in phyllody as compared to flower, providing valuable evidence for their involvement in flower development. This study is the first comprehensive analysis of the MADS-box family in jujube, and provides valuable information for elucidating molecular regulation mechanism of jujube flower development.

Aim of the study: This study aims to determine the genetic cause of PRS. Results: The reciprocal translocation t(4; 6)(q22; p21) was identified to be segregated with PRS in a three-generation family. Whole-genome sequencing and Sanger sequencing successfully detected breakpoints in the intragenic regions of BMRP1B and GRM4. We hypothesized that PRS in this family was caused by (i) haploinsufficiency for BMPR1B or (ii) a gain of function mechanism mediated by the BMPR1B-GRM4 fusion gene. In an unrelated family, we identified another BMPR1B-splicing mutation that co-segregated with PRS. Conclusion: We detected two BMPR1B mutations in two unrelated PRS families, suggesting that BMPR1B disruption is probably a cause of human PRS. Methods: GTG banding, comparative genomic hybridization, whole-genome sequencing, and Sanger sequencing were performed to identify the gene causing PRS.

Especially for plants, our understanding of miRNA targets, is still limited. Early attempts of prediction on sequence alignments have been plagued by enormous false positives. It is helpful to improve target prediction specificity by incorporating the other data sources such as the dependency between miRNA and transcript expression or even cleaved transcripts by miRNA regulations, which are referred to as trans-omics data. In this paper, we developed MiRTrans (Prediction of MiRNA targets by Trans-omics data) to explore miRNA targets by incorporating miRNA sequencing, transcriptome sequencing, and degradome sequencing. MiRTrans consisted of three major steps. First, the target transcripts of miRNAs were predicted by scrutinizing their sequence characteristics and collected as an initial potential targets pool. Second, false positive targets were eliminated if the expression of miRNA and its targets were weakly correlated by lasso regression. Third, degradome sequencing was utilized to capture the miRNA targets by examining the cleaved transcripts that regulated by miRNAs. Finally, the predicted targets from the second and third step were combined by Fisher's combination test. MiRTrans was applied to identify the miRNA targets for Capsicum spp. (i.e., pepper). It can generate more functionalmiRNA targets than sequence-based predictions by evaluating functional enrichment. MiRTrans identified 58 miRNA-transcript pairs with high confidence from 18 miRNA families conserved in eudicots. Most of these targets were transcription factors; this lent support to the role of miRNA as key regulator in pepper. To our best knowledge, this work is the first attempt to investigate the miRNA targets of pepper, as well as their regulatory networks. Surprisingly, only a small proportion of miRNA-transcript pairs were shared between degradome sequencing and expression dependency predictions, suggesting that miRNA targets predicted by a single technology alone may be prone to report false negatives.

From perspective of seed evo-devo, the most crucial developmental stage in this innovation is seed maturation, which includes accumulation of storage reserves, acquisition of desiccation tolerance, and induction of dormancy. Based on previous studies of seed development in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, seed maturation is mainly controlled by the LAFL regulatory network, which includes LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1) and LEC1-LIKE (L1L) of the NF-YB gene family, and ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE3 (ABI3), FUSCA3 (FUS3), and LEC2 (LEAFY COTYLEDON2) of the B3-AFL gene family. In the present study, molecular evolution of these LAFL genes was analyzed, using representative species from across the major plant lineages. Additionally, to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the seed maturation program, co-expression pattern analyses of LAFL genes were conducted across vascular plants. The results show that the origin of AFL gene family dates back to a common ancestor of bryophytes and vascular plants, while LEC1-type genes are only found in vascular plants. LAFL genes of vascular plants likely specify their co-expression in two different developmental phrases, spore and seed maturation, respectively, and expression patterns vary slightly across the major vascular plants lineages. All the information presented in this study will provide insights into the origin and diversification of seed plants.

An East Asian Common Variant Vinculin P.Asp841His Was Associated With Sudden Unexplained Nocturnal Death Syndrome in the Chinese Han Population	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION			English	Article						cardiac sodium channel; sudden cardiac death; sudden unexplained nocturnal death syndrome; vinculin	CELL-DERIVED CARDIOMYOCYTES; DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY; BRUGADA-SYNDROME; MOLECULAR AUTOPSY; MISSENSE MUTATION; STRUCTURAL BASIS; SOUTHERN CHINA; SODIUM CURRENT; METAVINCULIN; DISORDER	Background-We have identified the cardiomyopathy-susceptibility gene vinculin (VCL) mutation M941 may account for a sudden unexplained nocturnal death syndrome (SUNDS) case. We addressed whether VCL common variant D841H is associated with SUNDS. Methods and Results-In 8 of 120 SUNDS cases, we detected an East Asian common VCL variant p.Asp841His (D841H). Comparing the H841 allele frequency of the general population in the local database (15 of 1818) with SUNDS victims (10 of 240) gives an odds ratio for SUNDS of 5.226 (95% Cl, 2.321, 11.769). The VCL-D841H variant was engineered and either coexpressed with cardiac sodium channel (SCN5A) in HEK293 cells or overexpressed in human induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes to examine its effects on sodium channel function using the whole-cell patch-clamp method. In HEK293 cells, under physiological pH conditions (pH 7.4), D841H caused a 29% decrease in peak I-Na amplitude compared to wild type (WT), whereas under acidotic conditions (pH 7.0), D841H decreased further to 43% along with significant negative shift in inactivation compared to WT at pH 7.4. In induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes, similar effects of D841H on I-Na were observed. VCL colocalized with SCN5A at the intercalated disk in human cardiomyocytes. VCL was also confirmed to directly interact with SCN5A, and VCL-D841H did not disrupt the association of VCL and SCN5A. Conclusions-A VCL common variant was genetically and biophysically associated with Chinese SUNDS. The aggravation of loss of function of SCN5A caused by VCL-D841H under acidosis supports that nocturnal sleep respiratory disorders with acidosis may play a key role in the pathogenesis of SUNDS.

The raw data were filtered, and 221 million clean reads were used for further analysis. A total of 1,983,332 SNPs were obtained from 23 Eriobotrya species and two relative genera. We obtained similar results by neighbor-joining and maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees. All Eriobotrya plants grouped together into a big clade, and two out-groups clustered together into a single or separate clade. Chinese and Vietnam accessions were distributed throughout the dendrogram. There was nonsignificant correlation between genotype and geographical distance. However, clustering results were correlated with leaf size to some extent. The Eriobotrya species could be divided into following three groups based on leaf size and phylogenetic analysis: group A and group B comprised of small leaves with <10cm length except E.stipularis (16.76cm), and group C can be further divided into two subgroups, which contained medium-size leaves with a leaf length ranged from 10 to 20cm and a leaf length bigger than 20cm.

Conventionally, this technique is used to treat the mixed soil of a site without considering the diversity and treatability of different soils within the site. A laboratory test was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of mechanical soil aeration for remediating soils of different textures (silty, clayey, and sandy soils) along a vertical profile at an abandoned chloro-alkali chemical site in China. The collected soils were artificially contaminated with chloroform (TCM) and trichloroethylene (TCE). Mechanical soil aeration was effective for remediating VCHs (removal efficiency >98%). The volatilization process was described by an exponential kinetic function. In the early stage of treatment (0-7 hr), rapid contaminant volatilization followed a pseudo first order kinetic model. VCH concentrations decreased to low levels and showed a tailing phenomenon with very slow contaminant release after 8 hr. Compared with silty and sandy soils, clayey soil has high organic-matter content, a large specific surface area, a high clay fraction, and a complex pore structure. These characteristics substantially influenced the removal process, making it less efficient, more time consuming, and consequently more expensive. Our findings provide a potential basis for optimizing soil remediation strategy in a cost-effective manner. (C) 2016 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Genomic analysis is conducted to identify genetic alterations in driver genes which are all druggable targets for cancer therapy. In the present study, we performed an exome sequencing of 45 driver genes in 100 paired samples from HCC patients including tumors and matched adjacent normal tissues using Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Non -synonymous mutations were ascertained using the iPLEX MassARRAY system and Sanger sequencing. Clinicopathological relevance with genetic variations was assessed using SPSS software. The prognostic analyses of patients with gene mutation status were summarized using Kaplan -Meier curves. Sixty-one non -synonymous somatic mutations were identified in 43% of the HCC patients. The most frequent mutations were: TP53 (20%), RET (6%), PLCE1 (5%), PTEN (4%) and VEGFR2 (3%). Patients with mutations in TP53 had a lower overall survival (OS) (P=0.002) than those without mutations. Recurrent mutations in the Ret proto-oncogene (RET) were associated with poor outcomes for both disease -free survival (DFS) (P=0.028) and OS (P=0.001) in HCC patients. The mutational status of sorafenib-targeted genes were associated with decreased DFS (P=0.039), and decreased OS (P=0.15) without statistical significance. Mutual exclusion of TP53 and RET mutations were observed in the present study. In conclusion, patients with TP53 mutations, RET mutations and sorafenib-targeted gene mutations were demonstrated to be associated with poor HCC prognosis, which suggests that both TP53 and RET may serve as biomarkers of prognostic evaluation and targeted therapy in HCC.

Longan is an edible drupe fruit and a source of traditional medicine with polyphenol-rich traits. Tree size, alternate bearing, and witches' broom disease still pose serious problems. To gain insights into the genomic basis of longan traits, a draft genome sequence was assembled. The draft genome (about 471.88 Mb) of a Chinese longan cultivar, "Honghezi," was estimated to contain 31 007 genes and 261.88 Mb of repetitive sequences. No recent whole-genome-wide duplication event was detected in the genome. Whole-genome resequencing and analysis of 13 cultivated D. longan accessions revealed the extent of genetic diversity. Comparative transcriptome studies combined with genome-wide analysis revealed polyphenol-rich and pathogen resistance characteristics. Genes involved in secondary metabolism, especially those from significantly expanded (DHS, SDH, F3 ' H, ANR, and UFGT) and contracted (PAL, CHS, and F3 ' 5 ' H) gene families with tissue-specific expression, may be important contributors to the high accumulation levels of polyphenolic compounds observed in longan fruit. The high number of genes encoding nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) and leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase proteins, as well as the recent expansion and contraction of the NBS-LRR family, suggested a genomic basis for resistance to insects, fungus, and bacteria in this fruit tree.

Currently available methods work quite well in predicting peptide binding affinity with HLA alleles such as HLA-A*0201, HLA-A*0101, and HLA-B*0702 in terms of sensitivity and specificity. However, quite a few types of HLA alleles that are present in the majority of human populations including HLA-A*0202, HLA-A*0203, HLA-A*6802, HLA-B*5101, HLA-B*5301, HLA-B*5401, and HLA-B*5701 still cannot be predicted with satisfactory accuracy using currently available methods. Furthermore, currently the most popularly used methods for predicting peptide binding affinity are inefficient in identifying neoantigens from a large quantity of whole genome and transcriptome sequencing data. Here we present a Position Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM)-based software called PSSMHCpan to accurately and efficiently predict peptide binding affinity with a broad coverage of HLA class I alleles. We evaluated the performance of PSSMHCpan by analyzing 10-fold cross-validation on a training database containing 87 HLA alleles and obtained an average area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.94 and accuracy (ACC) of 0.85. In an independent dataset (Peptide Database of Cancer Immunity) evaluation, PSSMHCpan is substantially better than the popularly used NetMHC-4.0, NetMHCpan-3.0, PickPocket, Nebula, and SMM with a sensitivity of 0.90, as compared to 0.74, 0.81, 0.77, 0.24, and 0.79. In addition, PSSMHCpan is more than 197 times faster than NetMHC-4.0, NetMHCpan-3.0, PickPocket, sNebula, and SMM when predicting neoantigens from 661 263 peptides from a breast tumor sample. Finally, we built a neoantigen prediction pipeline and identified 117 017 neoantigens from 467 cancer samples of various cancers from TCGA. PSSMHCpan is superior to the currently available methods in predicting peptide binding affinity with a broad coverage of HLA class I alleles.

Here, we present the draft genome sequence of a male wisent individual descended from this founding stock. A total of 366 billion base pairs (Gb) of raw reads from whole-genome sequencing of this wisent were generated using the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform. The final genome assembly (2.58 Gb) is composed of 29,074 scaffolds with an N50 of 4.7 Mb. 47.3% of the genome is composed of repetitive elements. We identified 21,542 genes and 58,385 non-coding RNAs. A phylogenetic tree based on nuclear genomes indicated sister relationships between bison and wisent and between the wisent-bison clade and yak. For 75 genes we obtained evidence of positive evolution in the wisent lineage. We provide the first genome sequence and gene annotation for the wisent. The availability of these resources will be of value for the future conservation of this endangered large mammal and for reconstructing the evolutionary history of the Bovini tribe.

RED-ML: a novel, effective RNA editing detection method based on machine learning	GIGASCIENCE			English	Article						RNA editing; A-to-I editing; RNA-seq; posttranscriptional modification; machine learning	HUMAN-DISEASE; SEQ DATA; SITES; IDENTIFICATION; ADARS; TRANSCRIPTOME; LANDSCAPE; ALIGNER; CANCER	With the advancement of second generation sequencing techniques, our ability to detect and quantify RNA editing on a global scale has been vastly improved. As a result, RNA editing is now being studied under a growing number of biological conditions so that its biochemical mechanisms and functional roles can be further understood. However, a major barrier that prevents RNA editing from being a routine RNA-seq analysis, similar to gene expression and splicing analysis, for example, is the lack of user-friendly and effective computational tools. Based on years of experience of analyzing RNA editing using diverse RNA-seq datasets, we have developed a software tool, RED-ML: RNA Editing Detection based on Machine learning (pronounced as "red ML"). The input to RED-ML can be as simple as a single BAM file, while it can also take advantage of matched genomic variant information when available. The output not only contains detected RNA editing sites, but also a confidence score to facilitate downstream filtering. We have carefully designed validation experiments and performed extensive comparison and analysis to show the efficiency and effectiveness of RED-ML under different conditions, and it can accurately detect novel RNA editing sites without relying on curated RNA editing databases. We have also made this tool freely available via GitHub <https://github.com/BGIRED/RED-ML>. We have developed a highly accurate, speedy and general-purpose tool for RNA editing detection using RNA-seq data. With the availability of RED-ML, it is now possible to conveniently make RNA editing a routine analysis of RNA-seq. We believe this can greatly benefit the RNA editing research community and has profound impact to accelerate our understanding of this intriguing posttranscriptional modification process.

Typing and copy number determination for HLA-DRB3,-DRB4 and-DRB5 from next-generation sequencing data	HLA			English	Article						copy number; DRB3; DRB4; DRB5; HLA typing; NGS	STEM-CELL TRANSPLANTATION; HUMAN-LEUKOCYTE ANTIGEN; HLA; DISEASE; POPULATION; ASSOCIATIONS; EXPRESSION; MISMATCHES; HISTORY; GENOME	Background: HLA-DRB3, DRB4 and DRB5 (DRB3/4/5) are paralogues of HLA-DRB1. They have important roles in transplantation and have been reported to be related to many diseases. HLA typing methods for DRB3/4/5 based on NGS data have many limitations now, such as need of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or low accuracy. Materials and Methods: We present a HLA typing method for DRB3/4/5 based on read mapping and haplotype assembly from NGS data. Also, copy number of DRB3/4/5 is determined by a k-means clustering method according to ratio of sequencing depth between DRB3/4/5 and DRB1. Results: We achieved 100%, 100%, 100% accuracy on simulated data and 95.88%, 98.89%, 99.34% accuracy on MHC capture Illumina sequencing data at 4-digit resolution with 30-fold coverage for DRB3/4/5 separately. We also explored the DRB3/4/5 profiles in five continental populations through low coverage WGS data generated by the 1000 Genome Project. We found that frequency of DRB4 in African were significantly lower than that in all other populations. Conclusion: Our method for DRB3/4/5 typing has high accuracy. It is a good supplement to regular HLA typing and could help in disease studies, medical applications and human population diversity studies.

While the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) III system based on chloroplast sequences has opened up a new era of angiosperm molecular classification, the use of nuclear genome sequences is more helpful for a precise phylogenetic analysis. However, such attempts have so far been applied to only a very limited number of angiosperm plant families. We constructed a phylogenetic tree of 25 plant species with well assembled genome sequences representing 19 angiosperm families and one gymnosperm family (as out group) using 390 orthologous genes. Our results strongly support the moving of Rhamnaceae to order Rosales from Rhamnales, abolishing Rhamnales, and establishing the new order Malpighiales in the APG III system. Our data also showed some characteristics inconsistent with the APG III classification and provided a reinterpretation of phylogeny for some of the families involved. We propose that Malpighiales should be placed in Malvids, not Fabids. The four monocot species representing four families were clustered together, indicating that monocot is a natural taxon. In summary, our results support almost all the APGIII treatments of the orders involved in this study and provided some surprising reinterpretations at levels beyond order.

Here, we report the complete mitogenome sequence of P. carbo, which was 18,995 bp long and composed of 15 protein-coding genes, 25 tRNA genes, 2 rRNA genes and 2 control regions. Most genes were located on H-strand except for 10 tRNAs and 2 ND6 genes. In protein-coding genes, ATG, ATC and GTG were used as initiation codons, and TAA, AGA, AGG and TAG were used as stop codons. The 25 tRNA genes ranged in size from 67 to 75 bp. And 12S and 16S rRNA were respectively 983 and 1517 bp. Except for a tRNA-Ala in P. carbo which was different from the tRNA-Lys annotated in P. chalconotus, both species of Phalacrocorax had the same order of other genes. In addition, a phylogenetic analysis may help us understand the evolutionary status of this widespread species better.

Drills are among Africa's most endangered mammals, and are listed by the IUCN as the highest conservation priority of all African primates and are used as a model for cytomegalovirus vaccine and antiviral development. Here, we describe the complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) sequence of M. leucophaeus. The genome is 16 547 by in length, comprising 13 protein -coding genes, 22 tRNAs, 2 rRNAs and a major non -coding region. The gene content and order is in accord with the common vertebrate form. All PCGs share the start codon ATG except ND2(ATC), ND3(ATT) and ND5(ATA). ND1, ND2 and ATP8 use ATG as the end codon. COX1, COX2, ATP6, ND4L and ND5 employ AU as the end codon. The other five PCGs share the end codon T. Phylogenic tree was constructed based on the complete mitogenome of M. leucophaeus and 12 closely related species to estimate their phylogenic relationship.

The technology of cross breeding was the primary method to cultivate new maize varieties and promote the yield level. In recent years, more and more agriculturalists discovered the existence of endophyte in maize and their close relationship with soil environmental adaption which affect the production of maize. In this study, the seeds of six different maize varieties which were self-developed and cultivated from capital city of China "Beijing" and extensively planted in China were collected, this is the first time to acquire all of the "Beijing" hybrid maize to investigate their endopytes. We clarified eight species exists in all the varieties and the relative abundance of top three species including Pantoea agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae and Aeribacillus pallidus taken about 60 % of the whole endophyte. Besides these, we also discovered the correlations between the endophytic bacteria which might affect the growth of maize. On the other hand, the distributions of E. cloacae and A. pallidus between maize varieties with different male parent were apparently different. So we deduced the endophyte affect the environmental adaptation of different maize varieties and the results showed the light on the future maize variety cultivation from the angle of endophyte.

Due to its great economic value in China, the fish was introduced into Lake Dianchi and several other lakes from the Lake Taihu half a century ago. Similar to the Sinocyclocheilus cavefish, the clearhead icefish has certain cavefish-like traits, such as transparent body and nearly scaleless skin. Here, we provide the whole genome sequence of this surface-dwelling fish and generated a draft genome assembly, aiming at exploring molecular mechanisms for the biological interests. Findings: A total of 252.1 Gb of raw reads were sequenced. Subsequently, a novel draft genome assembly was generated, with the scaffold N50 reaching 1.163 Mb. The genome completeness was estimated to be 98.39 % by using the CEGMA evaluation. Finally, we annotated 19 884 protein-coding genes and observed that repeat sequences account for 24.43 % of the genome assembly. Conclusion: We report the first draft genome of the Chinese clearhead icefish. The genome assembly will provide a solid foundation for further molecular breeding and germplasm resource protection in Chinese clearhead icefish, as well as other icefishes. It is also a valuable genetic resource for revealing the molecular mechanisms for the cavefish-like characters.

Owing to its evolutionary position and four peculiar phenomenon of life (longevity, starvation tolerance, regenerative ability, and hatch without sunshine), it is an invaluable model species for research. However, lack of genomic resources leads to fewer study progresses in these fields, due to its huge genome of similar to 50 GB making it extremely difficult to be assembled. Results: We reported the sequenced transcriptome of more than 20 tissues from adult CGS using Illumina Hiseq 2000 technology, and a total of 93 366 no-redundancy transcripts with a mean length of 1326 bp were obtained. We developed for the first time an efficient pipeline to construct a high-quality reference gene set of CGS and obtained 26 135 coding genes. BUSCO and homologous assessment showed that our assembly captured 70.6% of vertebrate universal single-copy orthologs, and this coding gene set had a higher proportion of completeness CDS with comparable quality of the protein sets of Tibetan frog. Conclusions: These highest quality data will provide a valuable reference gene set to the subsequent research of CGS. In addition, our strategy of de novo transcriptome assembly and protein identification is applicable to similar studies.

Loss-of-function variants in the FMO3 gene are a known cause of TMAU. In addition to the inability to metabolize TMA precursors like choline, patients often emit a characteristic odor because while TMAO is odorless, TMA has a fishy smell. The Monell Chemical Senses Center is a research institute with a program to evaluate people with odor complaints for TMAU. Methods: Here we evaluated ten subjects by (1) odor evaluation by a trained sensory panel, (2) analysis of their urine concentration of TMA relative to TMAO before and after choline ingestion, and (3) whole exome sequencing as well as subsequent variant analysis of all ten samples to investigate the genetics of TMAU. Results: While all subjects reported they often emitted a fish-like odor, none had this malodor during sensory evaluation. However, all were impaired in their ability to produce > 90% TMAO/TMA in their urine and thus met the criteria for TMAU. To probe for genetic causes, the exome of each subject was sequenced, and variants were filtered by genes with a known (FMO3) or expected effect on TMA metabolism function (other oxidoreductases). We filtered the remaining variants by allele frequency and predicated functional effects. We identified one subject that had a rare loss-of-function FMO3 variant and six with more common decreased-function variants. In other oxidoreductases genes, five subjects had four novel rare single-nucleotide polymorphisms as well as one rare insertion/deletion. Novel in this context means no investigators have previously linked these variants to TMAU although they are in dbSNP. Conclusions: Thus, variants in genes other than FMO3 may cause TMAU and the genetic variants identified here serve as a starting point for future studies of impaired TMA metabolism.

Whole-exome sequencing of individuals from an isolated population implicates rare risk variants in bipolar disorder	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; OXIDE SYNTHASE NOS1; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; FAROE-ISLANDS; DEMOGRAPHIC HISTORY; SCHIZOPHRENIA; GENES; POLYMORPHISM; MECHANISMS; MUTATIONS	Bipolar disorder affects about 1% of the world's population, and its estimated heritability is about 75%. Only few whole genome or whole-exome sequencing studies in bipolar disorder have been reported, and no rare coding variants have yet been robustly identified. The use of isolated populations might help finding variants with a recent origin, more likely to have drifted to higher frequency by chance. Following this approach, we investigated 28 bipolar cases and 214 controls from the Faroe Islands by whole exome sequencing, and the results were followed-up in a British sample of 2025 cases and 1358 controls. Seventeen variants in 16 genes in the single-variant analysis, and 3 genes in the gene-based statistics surpassed exome-wide significance in the discovery phase. The discovery findings were supported by enrichment analysis of common variants from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data and interrogation of protein-protein interaction networks. The replication in the British sample confirmed the association with NOS1 (missense variant rs79487279) and NCL (gene-based test). A number of variants from the discovery set were not present in the replication sample, including a novel PITPNM2 missense variant, which is located in a highly significant schizophrenia GWAS locus. Likewise, PIK3C2A identified in the gene-based analysis is located in a combined bipolar and schizophrenia GWAS locus. Our results show support both for existing findings in the literature, as well as for new risk genes, and identify rare variants that might provide additional information on the underlying biology of bipolar disorder.

However, RNA editing in advanced lung adenocarcinomas has not yet been studied. Based on whole genome and transcriptome sequencing data, we identified 1,071,296 RNA editing events from matched normal, primary and metastatic samples contributed by 24 lung adenocarcinoma patients, with 91.3% A-to-G editing on average, and found significantly more RNA editing sites in tumors than in normal samples. To investigate cancer relevant editing events, we detected 67,851 hyper-editing sites in primary and 50,480 hyper-editing sites in metastatic samples. 46 genes with hyper-editing in coding regions were found to result in amino acid alterations, while hundreds of hyper-editing events in non-coding regions could modulate splicing or gene expression, including genes related to tumor stage or clinic prognosis. Comparing RNA editome of primary and metastatic samples, we also discovered hyper-edited genes that may promote metastasis development. These findings showed a landscape of RNA editing in matched normal, primary and metastatic tissues of lung adenocarcinomas for the first time and provided new insights to understand the molecular characterization of this disease.

Five independent biological studies Were carried out in parallel. Genetic markers suggested the existence of different genetic populations in the transition area. Growth backcalculation with otoliths resulted in significant although limited differences in growth rates between North Sea and Skagerrak, indicating weak differentiation or important mixing. Hydrogeographical drift modelling suggested that some North Sea juveniles could settle along the coast line of the Skagerrak and the Kattegat. Tagging data suggested that both juveniles and adult fish from the North Sea perform feeding migrations into Skagerrak in summer/autumn. Finally, survey data suggested that Skagerrak also belongs to the area distribution of North Sea plaice. The outcomes of the individual studies were then combined into an overall synthesis. The existence of some resident components was evidenced, but it was also demonstrated that North Sea plaice migrate for feeding into Skagerrak and might constitute a large share of the catches in this area. The mixing of different populations within a management area has implications for stock assessment and management. Choice must be made to either lump or split the populations, and the feasibility and constraints of both options are discussed. The outcomes of this work have directly influenced the management decisions in 2015. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Resequencing of 184 foxtail millet recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was carried out to aid essential research on foxtail millet improvement. A total 483 414 single nucleotide polymorphisms were determined. Bin maps were constructed based on the RILs' recombination data. Based on the high-density bin map, we updated Zhanggu reference with 416 Mb after adding 16 Mb unanchored scaffolds and Yugu reference with some assembly error correction and 3158 gaps filled. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping of nine agronomic traits was done based on this RIL population, five of which were controlled by a single gene. Meanwhile, two QTLs were found for plant height, and a candidate gene showed 89% identity to the known rice gibberellin-synthesis gene sd1. Three QTLs were found for the trait of heading date. The whole genome resequencing and QTL mapping provided important tools for foxtail millet research and breeding. Resequencing of the RILs could also provide an effective way for high-quality genome assembly and gene identification.

Recent genomics studies using next generation sequencing (NGS) technique have identified a large number of genetic variants including copy number (CNV) and single nucleotide variant (SNV) in a small set of genes from individuals with epilepsy. These discoveries have contributed significantly to evaluate the etiology of epilepsy in clinic and lay the foundation to develop molecular specific treatment. However, the molecular basis for a majority of epilepsy patients remains elusive, and furthermore, most of these studies have been conducted in Caucasian children. Here we conducted a targeted exome-sequencing of 63 trios of Chinese epilepsy families using a custom-designed NGS panel that covers 412 known and candidate genes for epilepsy. We identified pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in 15 of 63 (23.8%) families in known epilepsy genes including SCN1A, CDKL5, STXBP1, CHD2, SCN3A, SCN9A, TSC2, MBD5, POLG and EFHC1. More importantly, we identified likely pathologic variants in several novel candidate genes such as GABRE, MYH1, and CLCN6. Our results provide the evidence supporting the application of custom-designed NGS panel in clinic and indicate a conserved genetic susceptibility for epilepsy between Chinese and Caucasian children.

To investigate the underlying genetic defect in three-generations of a Chinese family with autosomal dominant congenital cataracts, we recruited family members who underwent comprehensive ophthalmic examinations. A heterozygous missense mutation c.634G > C (p.G212R) substitution was identified in the MIP gene through target region capture sequencing. The prediction results of PolyPhen-2 and SIFT indicated that this mutation was likely to damage the structure and function of MIP. Confocal microscopy images showed that the intensity of the green fluorescent signal revealed much weaker signal from the mutant compared to the wild-type MIP. The expressed G212R-MIP was diminished and almost exclusively cytoplasmic in the HeLa cells; whereas the WT-MIP was stable dispersed throughout the cytoplasm, and it appeared to be in the membrane structure. Western blot analysis indicated that the protein expression level of the mutant form of MIP was remarkably reduced compared with that of the wild type, however, the mRNA levels of the wild-type and mutant cells were comparable. In conclusion, our study presented genetic and functional evidence for a novel MIP mutation of G212R, which leads to congenital progressive cortical punctate with or without Y suture.

Pathogenic variants associated with Brugada syndrome have been identified in over 19 genes, with SCN5A as a pivotal gene accounting for nearly 30% of cases. In contrast to other arrhythmogenic channelopathies (such as long QT syndrome), digenic inheritance has never been reported in Brugada syndrome. Exploring 66 cardiac genes using a new custom next-generation sequencing panel, we identified a double heterozygosity for pathogenic mutations in SCN5A and TRPM4 in a Brugada syndrome patient. The parents were heterozygous for each variation. This novel finding highlights the role of mutation load in Brugada syndrome and strongly suggests the adoption of a gene panel to obtain an accurate genetic diagnosis, which is mandatory for risk stratification, prevention, and therapy.

Characterizing miRNAs and their targets is crucial to understanding the role of miRNAs during seed dormancy in this species. Considering the limited genome information of this species, we first sequenced and assembled the transcriptome data of dormant seeds and their seed coats as the reference genome. A total of 146,671 unigenes with an average length of 923 bp were identified and showed functional diversity based on different annotation methods. Two small RNA libraries from respective seeds and seed coats were sequenced and the combining data indicates that 263 conserved miRNAs belonging to at least 83 families and 768 novel miRNAs in 1174 transcripts were found. The annotations of the predicted putative targets of miRNAs suggest that these miRNAs were mainly involved in the cell, metabolism and genetic information processing by direct and indirect regulation patterns in dormant seeds of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis. Therefore, we provide the first known miRNA profiles and their targets, which will assist with further study of the molecular mechanism of seed dormancy in P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis.

SURFACE-WATER; MOBILITY; PB; SWEDEN	A total of eight military shooting ranges were used for this study. Soil samples were collected at each of the eight shooting ranges at the berm, target line, 50 and 100 m from berm. In all of the shooting ranges investigated the highest total lead (Pb) concentrations were found in the berm soils. Elevated Pb concentrations of 38 406.87 mg kg(-1) were found in the berm soils of TAB shooting range. Most of the shooting range soils contained high levels of Pb in the range above 2000 mg kg(-1) far exceeding the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) critical value of 400 mg kg(-1) . The predominant weathering products in these shooting ranges were cerussite(PbCO3) and hydrocerussite (Pb-3(CO3)(2)(OH)(2)). The Synthetic Precipitation Leaching Procedure (SPLP) Pb concentrations exceeded the USEPA 0.015 mg kg(-1) critical level of hazardous waste indicating possible contamination of surface and groundwater.

Mature adipocytes were isolated from epididymal and inguinal adipose tissues of ob/ob and DIO C57BL/6J mice. DNA methylation was analyzed by MeDIP-sequencing and gene expression by microarray analysis. The majority of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were hypomethylated in obese mice. Global methylation of long interspersed elements indicated that hypomethylation did not reflect methyl donor deficiency. In both DIO and ob/ob mice, we observed more obesity-associated methylation changes in epididymal than in inguinal adipocytes. Assignment of DMRs to promoter, exon, intron and intergenic regions demonstrated that DIO-induced changes in DNA methylation in C57BL/6J mice occurred primarily in exons, whereas inguinal adipocytes of ob/ob mice exhibited a higher enrichment of DMRs in promoter regions than in other regions of the genome, suggesting an influence of leptin on DNA methylation in inguinal adipocytes. We observed altered methylation and expression of 9 genes in epididymal adipocytes, including the known obesity-associated genes, Ehd2 and Kctd15, and a novel candidate gene, Irf8, possibly involved in immune type 1/type2 balance. The use of 2 obesity models enabled us to dissociate changes associated with high fat feeding from those associated with obesity per se. This information will be of value in future studies on the mechanisms governing the development of obesity and changes in adipocyte function associated with obesity.

The treatment of AF is challenging. Surgery was the main treatment modality for AF in the past, other strategies including radiotherapy, systemic therapies and wait-and-see policy. The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and targeted therapies has demonstrated good results. In the case report, a 39-year-old man presented with progressive chest wall pain. Computed tomography (CT) showed an approximately 46x 13mm soft-tissue mass between the inside of the fifth and sixth rib on the right side. The entire mass was excised and an AF was confirmed based on histopathology. Four months after surgery, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a soft-tissue mass in surgical areas and biopsy confirmed local recurrence. Therefore, Tomotherapy was administered. However, two months later, an (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) Positron Emission Tomography combined with CT (PET-CT) revealed the presence of an FDG-avid mass in the area of local recurrence. Genetic testing reported the presence of a p.T41A mutations on the CTNNB1 gene, which predicted that he is sensitive to the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib. The tumor regressed rapidly after the application of celecoxib. Within the 20-month follow-up period, the patient showed remarkable regression without any signs and symptoms. Our case report provides further evidence for the efficacy of celecoxib in AF with CTNNB1 gene mutations. To our knowledge, this is the first report of AF treated with celecoxib under the guidance of the genetic testing. However, further studies are required.

The addition of LFR prior to WGS on any high-throughput DNA sequencer (e.g., Complete Genomics Revolocity (TM), BGISEQ-500, Illumina HiSeq, etc.) enables the assignment of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and other genomic variants onto contigs representing contiguous DNA from a single parent (haplotypes) with N50 lengths of up to similar to 1 Mb. Importantly, this is achieved independent of any parental sequencing data or knowledge of parental haplotypes. Further, the nature of this method allows for the correction of most amplification, sequencing, and mapping errors, resulting in false-positive error rates as low as 10(-9). This method can be employed either manually using hand-held micropipettors or in the preferred, automated manner described below, utilizing liquid-handling robots capable of pipetting in the nanoliter range. Automating the method limits the amount of hands-on time and allows significant reduction in reaction volumes. Further, the cost of LFR, as described in this chapter, is moderate, while it adds invaluable whole genome haplotype data to almost any WGS process.

One such mechanism by which it exerts its antitumor activity is antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, which has been reported to be influenced by Fc gamma RIIA and IIIA polymorphisms. This study is the first to assess their impact on trastuzumab efficacy in patients with metastatic gastric cancer. We retrospectively examined 42 Her-2-positive patients receiving fluorouracil and platinum-based chemotherapy and trastuzumab, and 68 Her-2-negative patients receiving fluorouracil and platinum-based chemotherapy only as the first-line treatment. Fc gamma RIIA and IIIA polymorphisms were assessed, and their associations with efficacy in both settings were analyzed. In patients treated with trastuzumab, the Fc gamma RIIA H/H genotype was associated with significantly superior progression-free survival (PFS) (hazard ratio [HR] [95% CI]: 0.36 [0.16-0.82], adjusted HR [95% CI]: 0.18 [0.07-0.48], P=0.001). When combining Fc gamma RIIA and IIIA polymorphisms, the Fc gamma RIIA H/H or Fc gamma RIIIA V/V genotype was associated with a significantly improved disease control rate (P=0.04) and PFS (HR [95% CI]: 0.29 [0.13-0.67], adjusted HR [95% CI]: 0.17 [0.07-0.45], P < 0.001). As expected, no association of Fc gamma RIIA and IIIA polymorphisms with efficacy was found in patients receiving chemotherapy only. We concluded that Fc gamma RIIA and IIIA polymorphisms might predict disease control rate and PFS in metastatic gastric cancer patients receiving trastuzumab treatment.

The first clinical manifestation has been described during the first decade of life, linked to strenuous exercise or acute emotion. The absence of structural heart disease and a family history of possible arrhythmogenic disorder generally guide the diagnosis towards a potential channelopathy.

Although putative virulence factors have been identified, the mechanism of pathogenesis of V. anguillarum is not fully understood. Here, we analyzed whole-genome sequences of a collection of V. anguillarum strains and compared them to virulence of the strains as determined in larval challenge assays. Previously identified virulence factors were globally distributed among the strains, with some genetic diversity. However, the pan-genome revealed that six out of nine high-virulence strains possessed a unique accessory genome that was attributed to pathogenic genomic islands, prophage-like elements, virulence factors, and a new set of gene clusters involved in biosynthesis, modification, and transport of polysaccharides. In contrast, V. anguillarum strains that were medium to nonvirulent had a high degree of genomic homogeneity. Finally, we found that a phylogeny based on the core genomes clustered the strains with moderate to no virulence, while six out of nine high-virulence strains represented phylogenetically separate clusters. Hence, we suggest a link between genotype and virulence characteristics of Vibrio anguillarum, which can be used to unravel the molecular evolution of V. anguillarum and can also be important from survey and diagnostic perspectives. IMPORTANCE Comparative genome analysis of strains of a pathogenic bacterial species can be a powerful tool to discover acquisition of mobile genetic elements related to virulence. Here, we compared 28 V. anguillarum strains that differed in virulence in fish larval models. By pan-genome analyses, we found that six of nine highly virulent strains had a unique core and accessory genome. In contrast, V. anguillarum strains that were medium to nonvirulent had low genomic diversity. Integration of genomic and phenotypic features provides insights into the evolution of V. anguillarum and can also be important for survey and diagnostic purposes.

Synonymous mutation is the single nucleotide change that does not cause an amino acid change but can affect the rate and efficiency of translation. So recent increase in our knowledge has revealed a substantial contribution of synonymous mutations to human disease risk and other complex traits. Nevertheless, there are still rarely synonymous mutation prediction methods. Methods. Nonsynonymous and synonymous coding SNPs show similar likelihood and effect size of human disease association. Here we defined synonymous andmissense variation as single nucleotide substitution variation. And then we evaluated the intolerance of genic transcripts to single nucleotide substitution variation based on gnomAD123136 individuals. After regressing all variations on common variations, we defined residuals of regressionmodel as every genomics region intolerance scores. Results. We constructed a total of 24799 nonoverlapped region-based intolerance score by their intolerance to single nucleotide substitution variation (Syntool). The results show that Syntool score can discriminate synonymous disease causing mutations in Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD Professional) and ClinVar database much better than others. Taken together, this study provides a novel prediction system for synonymous mutations, called Syntool, which could be helpful in identifying candidate synonymous disease causing mutations.

Increased expression of LncRNA BANCR and its prognostic significance in human epithelial ovarian cancer	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GYNAECOLOGICAL ONCOLOGY			English	Article						Long non-coding RNA; BANCR; Ovarian cancer; Prognosis	LONG NONCODING RNA; POOR-PROGNOSIS; MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION; METASTASIS; CARCINOMA; MIGRATION; CELLS	Purpose: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been proved to play important roles in the tumorigenesis and development of human epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression and clinical value of BRAF-activated non coding RNA (BANCR) in EOC patients. Materials and Methods: BANCR expression was detected in 84 EOC and 36 normal ovarian epithelial tissue samples. Association between BANCR levels and clinicopathological factors and patient prognosis was also analyzed. Results: BANCR expression was increased in EOC compared with normal ovarian epithelial tissues. Moreover, high expression of BANCR was closely correlated with advanced FIGO stage, higher serum CA125 expression level, and lymph node metastasis. Multivariate regression analysis identified BANCR overexpression as an independent unfavorable prognostic factor in EOC patients. Conclusions: These findings suggested that BANCR may act as a tumor promoter in EOC and would be a novel diagnostic and prognostic marker for this disease.

BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH-INDIA			English	Article						TCR repertoire; Pregnancy; High throughput sequencing; Immune	PERIPHERAL-BLOOD; TOLERANCE; IMPLANTATION; PROMOTES	High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) is a feasible approach for characterizing T-Cell Receptor (TCR) repertoire, and this technology has been applied in various diseases. For a pregnant woman, immunologic balance may be interrupted when the foetus grow up. How to adjust the mother's immune system and what's the difference before and after pregnancy are limited known. Herein, we use the multiplex PCR method to amplify TCR-beta repertoire for both pregnant women and non-pregnant women. Total 12 samples are sequenced by HTS which produce on average 6.43 million sequences for each sample. We observe that the repertoire diversity and CDR3 number tend to decline slowly in gestation period. The content of high-frequency is found remarkably expended at the second trimester and then shrunken at the third trimester. Pregnant samples are clustered together and non-pregnant samples are clustered to another group using both V genes and V-J pairings. Furthermore, seven V genes which are significantly different between two groups are identified. Finally, high-frequency clones of a pregnant woman are visualized among three time-point pregnancies. Our study can provide new insight into understanding the immune response during the pregnancy, and the repertoire characteristics would provide a reference for other investigators.

Previous studies had provided evidence that HBV integration may be an important factor for HCC carcinogenesis. In order to establish a new strategy for HCC diagnosis, a novel method was deployed to screen for HBV integration sites in both the HCC tumor and the paired plasma samples. HBV (type B) infections were detected in both patients, and a total number of 24 HBV viral integration sites were documented. Interestingly, one of the integration sites, in particular, was detected in both the HCC tumor and the paired plasma samples. In addition, it was noticed that HBV breakpoints inclined to the region of X protein (1,700-2,000 bp) in both the HCC tumor and the paired plasma samples. Altogether, our results provided evidence for HBV integration in plasma DNA, and they might be potentially useful for future HCC prognosis and diagnosis.

To search for optimal therapeutic targets for enhancing the efficacy, we used whole-exome sequencing data of 23 early cervical tumors from Chinese women to investigate the hierarchical structure of the somatic mutations and the neo-epitopes. The putative neo-epitopes were predicted based on the mutant peptides' strong binding with major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. We found that each tumor carried an average of 117 mutations and 61 putative neo-epitopes. Each patient displayed a unique phylogenetic tree in which almost all subclones harbored neo-epitopes, highlighting the importance of individual neo-epitope tree in determination of immunotherapeutic targets. The alterations in FBXW7 and PIK3CA, or other members of the significantly altered ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and extracellular matrix receptor interaction related pathways, were proposed as the earliest changes triggering the malignant progression. The neo-epitopes involved in these pathways, and located at the top of the hierarchy tree, might become the optimal candidates for therapeutic targets, possessing the potential to mediate T-cell killing of the descendant cells. These findings expanded our understanding in early stage of cervical carcinogenesis and offered an important approach to assist optimizing the immunotherapeutic target selection.

Viper Venom Botox: The Molecular Origin and Evolution of the Waglerin Peptides Used in Anti-Wrinkle Skin Cream	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION			English	Article							NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR; TRIMERESURUS-WAGLERI; PIT VIPER; SNAKE; TOXIN; PROTEINS	The molecular origin of waglerin peptides has remained enigmatic despite their industrial application in skin cream products to paralyse facial muscles and thus reduce the incidence of wrinkles. Here we show that these neurotoxic peptides are the result of de novo evolution within the prepro region of the C-type natriuretic peptide gene in Tropidolaemus venoms, at a site distinct from the domain encoding for the natriuretic peptide. It is the same region that yielded the azemiopsin peptides from Azemiops feae, indicative of a close relationship of this toxin gene between these two genera. The precursor region for the molecular evolution is a biodiversity hotspot that has yielded other novel bioactive peptides with novel activities. We detail the diversity of components in this and other species in order to explore what characteristics enable it to be such a biodiscovery treasure trove. The unusual function of Tropidolaemus venoms may have been selected for due to evolutionary pressures brought about by a high likelihood of prey escape.
