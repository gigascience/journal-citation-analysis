Abstract = {{De novo mutation plays an important role in autism spectrum disorders
   (ASDs). Notably, pathogenic copy number variants (CNVs) are
   characterized by high mutation rates. We hypothesize that
   hypermutability is a property of ASD genes and may also include
   nucleotide-substitution hot spots. We investigated global patterns of
   germline mutation by whole-genome sequencing of monozygotic twins
   concordant for ASD and their parents. Mutation rates varied widely
   throughout the genome (by 100-fold) and could be explained by intrinsic
   characteristics of DNA sequence and chromatin structure. Dense clusters
   of mutations within individual genomes were attributable to compound
   mutation or gene conversion. Hypermutability was a characteristic of
   genes involved in ASD and other diseases. In addition, genes impacted by
   mutations in this study were associated with ASD in independent
   exome-sequencing data sets. Our findings suggest that regional
   hypermutation is a significant factor shaping patterns of genetic
   variation and disease risk in humans.}},

Title = {{Transcriptomic analysis of `Suli' pear (Pyrus pyrifolia white pear
   group) buds during the dormancy by RNA-Seq}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{DEC 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: Bud dormancy is a critical developmental process that allows
   perennial plants to survive unfavorable environmental conditions. Pear
   is one of the most important deciduous fruit trees in the world, but the
   mechanisms regulating bud dormancy in this species are unknown. Because
   genomic information for pear is currently unavailable, transcriptome and
   digital gene expression data for this species would be valuable
   resources to better understand the molecular and biological mechanisms
   regulating its bud dormancy.
   Results: We performed de novo transcriptome assembly and digital gene
   expression (DGE) profiling analyses of `Suli' pear (Pyrus pyrifolia
   white pear group) using the Illumina RNA-seq system. RNA-Seq generated
   approximately 100 M high-quality reads that were assembled into 69,393
   unigenes (mean length = 853 bp), including 14,531 clusters and 34,194
   singletons. A total of 51,448 (74.1\%) unigenes were annotated using
   public protein databases with a cut-off E-value above 10(-5). We mainly
   compared gene expression levels at four time-points during bud dormancy.
   Between Nov. 15 and Dec. 15, Dec. 15 and Jan. 15, and Jan. 15 and Feb.
   15, 1,978, 1,024, and 3,468 genes were differentially expressed,
   respectively. Hierarchical clustering analysis arranged 190
   significantly differentially-expressed genes into seven groups. Seven
   genes were randomly selected to confirm their expression levels using
   quantitative real-time PCR.
   Conclusions: The new transcriptomes offer comprehensive sequence and DGE
   profiling data for a dynamic view of transcriptomic variation during bud
   dormancy in pear. These data provided a basis for future studies of
   metabolism during bud dormancy in non-model but economically-important
   perennial species.}},

Title = {{Gene-Centric Meta-Analysis of Lipid Traits in African, East Asian and
   Hispanic Populations}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{Meta-analyses of European populations has successfully identified
   genetic variants in over 100 loci associated with lipid levels, but our
   knowledge in other ethnicities remains limited. To address this, we
   performed dense genotyping of similar to 2,000 candidate genes in 7,657
   African Americans, 1,315 Hispanics and 841 East Asians, using the IBC
   array, a custom similar to 50,000 SNP genotyping array. Meta-analyses
   confirmed 16 lipid loci previously established in European populations
   at genome-wide significance level, and found multiple independent
   association signals within these lipid loci. Initial discovery and in
   silico follow-up in 7,000 additional African American samples, confirmed
   two novel loci: rs5030359 within ICAM1 is associated with total
   cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (p =
   8.8x10(-7) and p = 1.5x10(-6) respectively) and a nonsense mutation
   rs3211938 within CD36 is associated with high-density lipoprotein
   cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (p = 13.5x10(-1)2). The rs3211938-G allele,
   which is nearly absent in European and Asian populations, has been
   previously found to be associated with CD36 deficiency and shows a
   signature of selection in Africans and African Americans. Finally, we
   have evaluated the effect of SNPs established in European populations on
   lipid levels in multi-ethnic populations and show that most known lipid
   association signals span across ethnicities. However, differences
   between populations, especially differences in allele frequency, can be
   leveraged to identify novel signals, as shown by the discovery of ICAM1
   and CD36 in the current report.}},

Abstract = {{Prunus mume (mei), which was domesticated in China more than 3,000 years
   ago as ornamental plant and fruit, is one of the first genomes among
   Prunus subfamilies of Rosaceae been sequenced. Here, we assemble a 280M
   genome by combining 101-fold next-generation sequencing and optical
   mapping data. We further anchor 83.9\% of scaffolds to eight chromosomes
   with genetic map constructed by restriction-site-associated DNA
   sequencing. Combining P. mume genome with available data, we succeed in
   reconstructing nine ancestral chromosomes of Rosaceae family, as well as
   depicting chromosome fusion, fission and duplication history in three
   major subfamilies. We sequence the transcriptome of various tissues and
   perform genome-wide analysis to reveal the characteristics of P. mume,
   including its regulation of early blooming in endodormancy, immune
   response against bacterial infection and biosynthesis of flower scent.
   The P. mume genome sequence adds to our understanding of Rosaceae
   evolution and provides important data for improvement of fruit trees.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Conventional prenatal screening tests, such as maternal
   serum tests and ultrasound scan, have limited resolution and accuracy.
   Methods: We developed an advanced noninvasive prenatal diagnosis method
   based on massively parallel sequencing. The Noninvasive Fetal Trisomy
   (NIFTY) test, combines an optimized Student's t-test with a locally
   weighted polynomial regression and binary hypotheses. We applied the
   NIFTY test to 903 pregnancies and compared the diagnostic results with
   those of full karyotyping.
   Results: 16 of 16 trisomy 21, 12 of 12 trisomy 18, two of two trisomy
   13, three of four 45, X, one of one XYY and two of two XXY abnormalities
   were correctly identified. But one false positive case of trisomy 18 and
   one false negative case of 45, X were observed. The test performed with
   100\% sensitivity and 99.9\% specificity for autosomal aneuploidies and
   85.7\% sensitivity and 99.9\% specificity for sex chromosomal
   aneuploidies. Compared with three previously reported z-score approaches
   with/without GC-bias removal and with internal control, the NIFTY test
   was more accurate and robust for the detection of both autosomal and sex
   chromosomal aneuploidies in fetuses.
   Conclusion: Our study demonstrates a powerful and reliable methodology
   for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis.}},

Title = {{Genes Contributing to Pain Sensitivity in the Normal Population: An
   Exome Sequencing Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS GENETICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Sensitivity to pain varies considerably between individuals and is known
   to be heritable. Increased sensitivity to experimental pain is a risk
   factor for developing chronic pain, a common and debilitating but poorly
   understood symptom. To understand mechanisms underlying pain sensitivity
   and to search for rare gene variants (MAF<5\%) influencing pain
   sensitivity, we explored the genetic variation in individuals' responses
   to experimental pain. Quantitative sensory testing to heat pain was
   performed in 2,500 volunteers from TwinsUK (TUK): exome sequencing to a
   depth of 70 x was carried out on DNA from singletons at the high and low
   ends of the heat pain sensitivity distribution in two separate
   subsamples. Thus in TUK1, 101 pain-sensitive and 102 pain-insensitive
   were examined, while in TUK2 there were 114 and 96 individuals
   respectively. A combination of methods was used to test the association
   between rare variants and pain sensitivity, and the function of the
   genes identified was explored using network analysis. Using causal
   reasoning analysis on the genes with different patterns of SNVs by pain
   sensitivity status, we observed a significant enrichment of variants in
   genes of the angiotensin pathway (Bonferroni corrected p = 3.8 x
   10(-4)). This pathway is already implicated in animal models and human
   studies of pain, supporting the notion that it may provide fruitful new
   targets in pain management. The approach of sequencing extreme exome
   variation in normal individuals has provided important insights into
   gene networks mediating pain sensitivity in humans and will be
   applicable to other common complex traits.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To report the performance of massively parallel sequencing
   (MPS) based prenatal noninvasive fetal trisomy test based on cell-free
   DNA sequencing from maternal plasma in a routine clinical setting in
   China. Method The MPS-based test was offered as a prenatal screening
   test for trisomies 21 and 18 to pregnant women in 49 medical centers
   over 2?years. A total of 11?263 participants were recruited and the
   MPS-based test was performed in 11?105 pregnancies. Fetal outcome data
   were obtained after the expected date of confinement. Results One
   hundred ninety cases were classified as positive, including 143 cases of
   trisomy 21 and 47 cases of trisomy 18. With the karyotyping results and
   the feedback of fetal outcome data, we observed one false positive case
   of trisomy 21, one false positive case of trisomy 18 and no false
   negative cases, indicating 100\% sensitivity and 99.96\% specificity for
   the detection of trisomies 21 and 18. Conclusion Our large-scale
   multicenter study proved that the MPS-based test is of high sensitivity
   and specificity in detecting fetal trisomies 21 and 18. The introduction
   of this screening test into a routine clinical setting could avoid about
   98\% of invasive prenatal diagnostic procedures. (c) 2012 John Wiley \&
