We inferred the phylogeny of insects from 1478 protein-coding genes. Phylogenomic analyses of nucleotide and amino acid sequences, with site-specific nucleotide or domain-specific amino acid substitution models, produced statistically robust and congruent results resolving previously controversial phylogenetic relationships. We dated the origin of insects to the Early Ordovician [similar to 479 million years ago (Ma)], of insect flight to the Early Devonian (similar to 406 Ma), of major extant lineages to the Mississippian (similar to 345 Ma), and the major diversification of holometabolous insects to the Early Cretaceous. Our phylogenomic study provides a comprehensive reliable scaffold for future comparative analyses of evolutionary innovations among insects.

We recovered a highly resolved tree that confirms previously controversial sister or close relationships. We identified the first divergence in Neoaves, two groups we named Passerea and Columbea, representing independent lineages of diverse and convergently evolved land and water bird species. Among Passerea, we infer the common ancestor of core landbirds to have been an apex predator and confirm independent gains of vocal learning. Among Columbea, we identify pigeons and flamingoes as belonging to sister clades. Even with whole genomes, some of the earliest branches in Neoaves proved challenging to resolve, which was best explained by massive protein-coding sequence convergence and high levels of incomplete lineage sorting that occurred during a rapid radiation after the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction event about 66 million years ago.				publicationpage, cmec/B-4405-2017; Rahbek, Carsten/L-1129-2013; Ho, Simon/A-8417-2008; Capella-Gutierrez, Salvador/H-5053-2015; Jarvis, Erich/A-2319-2008; Fjeldsa, Jon/A-9699-2013; Prosdocimi, Francisco/F-6847-2012; Burt, David/C-7802-2013; Bruford, Michael/D-3750-2009; Alstrom, Per/C-1619-2015; Gilbert, Marcus/A-8936-2013; Munch, Kasper/A-1434-2010; publist, CMEC/C-3010-2012; da Fonseca, Rute/F-9143-2013; Stamatakis, Alexandros/B-8740-2009; Orlando, Ludovic/A-8932-2013; Schierup, Mikkel/F-1675-2010; Brumfield, Robb/K-6108-2015; Campos, Paula/B-1634-2010; Wang, Jun/C-8434-2016; Narula, Nitish/G-5784-2015; Zhang, Guojie/B-6188-2014; Samaniego Castruita, Jose Alfredo/B-9033-2015; Gabaldon, Toni/A-7336-2008; Perelman, Polina/N-8088-2015; Wang, Jun/B-9503-2016	Ho, Simon/0000-0002-0361-2307; Capella-Gutierrez, Salvador/0000-0002-0309-604X; Jarvis, Erich/0000-0001-8931-5049; Fjeldsa, Jon/0000-0003-0790-3600; Prosdocimi, Francisco/0000-0002-6761-3069; Burt, David/0000-0002-9991-1028; Bruford, Michael/0000-0001-6357-6080; Alstrom, Per/0000-0001-7182-2763; Gilbert, Marcus/0000-0002-5805-7195; Munch, Kasper/0000-0003-2880-6252; da Fonseca, Rute/0000-0002-2805-4698; Orlando, Ludovic/0000-0003-3936-1850; Schierup, Mikkel/0000-0002-5028-1790; Brumfield, Robb/0000-0003-2307-0688; Campos, Paula/0000-0003-1285-4671; Wang, Jun/0000-0002-8540-8931; Narula, Nitish/0000-0002-8309-8642; Zhang, Guojie/0000-0001-6860-1521; Samaniego Castruita, Jose Alfredo/0000-0001-5904-1198; Gabaldon, Toni/0000-0003-0019-1735; Perelman, Polina/0000-0002-0982-5100; Alfaro-Nunez, Alonzo/0000-0002-4050-5041; Li, Cai/0000-0001-7843-2151; Weber, Claudia/0000-0002-5910-8898; Subramanian, Sankar/0000-0002-2375-3254; Glenn, Travis/0000-0001-7725-3637; Mirarab, Siavash/0000-0001-5410-1518; Smeds, Linnea/0000-0002-8415-9259; Howard, Jason/0000-0003-3265-5127; Boussau, Bastien/0000-0003-0776-4460; Johnson, Warren/0000-0002-5954-186X; Faircloth, Brant/0000-0002-1943-0217; Suh, Alexander/0000-0002-8979-9992; Jonsson, Knud/0000-0002-1875-9504; Edwards, Scott/0000-0003-2535-6217; Wang, Jun/0000-0002-2113-5874; Shapiro, Beth/0000-0002-2733-7776; Bertelsen, Mads/0000-0001-9201-7499; Petersen, Bent/0000-0002-2472-8317; Wirthlin, Morgan/0000-0001-7967-7070; Braun, Edward/0000-0003-1643-5212; Scofield, Richard/0000-0002-7510-6980												0036-8075	1095-9203				DEC 12	2014	346	6215					1320	1331		10.1126/science.1253451								WOS:000346189600036	25504713					J	Song, YM; Li, L; Ou, YW; Gao, ZB; Li, EM; Li, XC; Zhang, WM; Wang, JQ; Xu, LY; Zhou, Y; Ma, XJ; Liu, LY; Zhao, ZT; Huang, XL; Fan, J; Dong, LJ; Chen, G; Ma, LY; Yang, J; Chen, LY; He, MH; Li, M; Zhuang, XH; Huang, K; Qiu, KL; Yin, GL; Guo, GW; Feng, Q; Chen, PS; Wu, ZY; Wu, JY; Ma, L; Zhao, JY; Luo, LH; Fu, M; Xu, BN; Chen, B; Li, YR; Tong, T; Wang, MR; Liu, ZH; Lin, DX; Zhang, XQ; Yang, HM; Wang, J; Zhan, QM				Song, Yongmei; Li, Lin; Ou, Yunwei; Gao, Zhibo; Li, Enmin; Li, Xiangchun; Zhang, Weimin; Wang, Jiaqian; Xu, Liyan; Zhou, Yong; Ma, Xiaojuan; Liu, Lingyan; Zhao, Zitong; Huang, Xuanlin; Fan, Jing; Dong, Lijia; Chen, Gang; Ma, Liying; Yang, Jie; Chen, Longyun; He, Minghui; Li, Miao; Zhuang, Xuehan; Huang, Kai; Qiu, Kunlong; Yin, Guangliang; Guo, Guangwu; Feng, Qiang; Chen, Peishan; Wu, Zhiyong; Wu, Jianyi; Ma, Ling; Zhao, Jinyang; Luo, Longhai; Fu, Ming; Xu, Bainan; Chen, Bo; Li, Yingrui; Tong, Tong; Wang, Mingrong; Liu, Zhihua; Lin, Dongxin; Zhang, Xiuqing; Yang, Huanming; Wang, Jun; Zhan, Qimin			Identification of genomic alterations in oesophageal squamous cell cancer	NATURE												Oesophageal cancer is one of the most aggressive cancers and is the sixth leading cause of cancer death worldwide(1). Approximately 70% of global oesophageal cancer cases occur in China, with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) being the histopathological form in the vast majority of cases (>90%)(2,3). Currently, there are limited clinical approaches for the early diagnosis and treatment of ESCC, resulting in a 10% five-year survival rate for patients. However, the full repertoire of genomic events leading to the pathogenesis of ESCC remains unclear. Here we describe a comprehensive genomic analysis of 158 ESCC cases, as part of the International Cancer Genome Consortium research project. We conducted whole-genome sequencing in 17 ESCC cases and whole-exome sequencing in 71 cases, of which 53 cases, plus an additional 70 ESCC cases not used in the whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing, were subjected to array comparative genomic hybridization analysis. We identified eight significantly mutated genes, of which six are well known tumour-associated genes (TP53, RB1, CDKN2A, PIK3CA, NOTCH1, NFE2L2), and two have not previously been described in ESCC (ADAM29 and FAM135B). Notably, FAM135B is identified as a novel cancer-implicated gene as assayed for its ability to promote malignancy of ESCC cells. Additionally, MIR548K, a microRNA encoded in the amplified 11q13.3-13.4 region, is characterized as a novel oncogene, and functional assays demonstrate that MIR548K enhances malignant phenotypes of ESCC cells. Moreover, we have found that several important histone regulator genes (MLL2 (also called KMT2D), ASH1L, MLL3 (KMT2C), SETD1B, CREBBP and EP300) are frequently altered in ESCC. Pathway assessment reveals that somatic aberrations are mainly involved in the Wnt, cell cycle and Notch pathways. Genomic analyses suggest that ESCC and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma share some common pathogenic mechanisms, and ESCC development is associated with alcohol drinking. This study has explored novel biological markers and tumorigenic pathways that would greatly improve therapeutic strategies for ESCC.

Here we sequenced and assembled the Gossypium arboreum (AA; 2n = 26) genome, a putative contributor of the A subgenome. A total of 193.6 Gb of clean sequence covering the genome by 112.6-fold was obtained by paired-end sequencing. We further anchored and oriented 90.4% of the assembly on 13 pseudochromosomes and found that 68.5% of the genome is occupied by repetitive DNA sequences. We predicted 41,330 protein-coding genes in G. arboreum. Two whole-genome duplications were shared by G. arboreum and Gossypium raimondii before speciation. Insertions of long terminal repeats in the past 5 million years are responsible for the twofold difference in the sizes of these genomes. Comparative transcriptome studies showed the key role of the nucleotide binding site (NBS)-encoding gene family in resistance to Verticillium dahliae and the involvement of ethylene in the development of cotton fiber cells.

Despite advances inmolecular systematics, some hypotheses of relationships remain weakly resolved. Inferring deep phylogenies with bouts of rapid diversification can be problematic; however, genome-scale data should significantly increase the number of informative characters for analyses. Recent phylogenomic reconstructions focused on the major divergences of plants have resulted in promising but inconsistent results. One limitation is sparse taxon sampling, likely resulting from the difficulty and cost of data generation. To address this limitation, transcriptome data for 92 streptophyte taxa were generated and analyzed along with 11 published plant genome sequences. Phylogenetic reconstructions were conducted using up to 852 nuclear genes and 1,701,170 aligned sites. Sixty-nine analyses were performed to test the robustness of phylogenetic inferences to permutations of the datamatrix or to phylogeneticmethod, including supermatrix, supertree, and coalescent-based approaches, maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods, partitioned and unpartitioned analyses, and amino acid versus DNA alignments. Among other results, we find robust support for a sister-group relationship between land plants and one group of streptophyte green algae, the Zygnematophyceae. Strong and robust support for a clade comprising liverworts and mosses is inconsistent with a widely accepted view of early land plant evolution, and suggests that phylogenetic hypotheses used to understand the evolution of fundamental plant traits should be reevaluated.

Dusko; Bork, Peer; Wang, Jun		MetaHIT Consortium	An integrated catalog of reference genes in the human gut microbiome	NATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY												Many analyses of the human gut microbiome depend on a catalog of reference genes. Existing catalogs for the human gut microbiome are based on samples from single cohorts or on reference genomes or protein sequences, which limits coverage of global microbiome diversity. Here we combined 249 newly sequenced samples of the Metagenomics of the Human Intestinal Tract (MetaHit) project with 1,018 previously sequenced samples to create a cohort from three continents that is at least threefold larger than cohorts used for previous gene catalogs. From this we established the integrated gene catalog (IGC) comprising 9,879,896 genes. The catalog includes close-to-complete sets of genes for most gut microbes, which are also of considerably higher quality than in previous catalogs. Analyses of a group of samples from Chinese and Danish individuals using the catalog revealed country-specific gut microbial signatures. This expanded catalog should facilitate quantitative characterization of metagenomic, metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic data from the gut microbiome to understand its variation across populations in human health and disease.

We explored bird macroevolution using full genomes from 48 avian species representing all major extant clades. The avian genome is principally characterized by its constrained size, which predominantly arose because of lineage-specific erosion of repetitive elements, large segmental deletions, and gene loss. Avian genomes furthermore show a remarkably high degree of evolutionary stasis at the levels of nucleotide sequence, gene synteny, and chromosomal structure. Despite this pattern of conservation, we detected many non-neutral evolutionary changes in protein-coding genes and noncoding regions. These analyses reveal that pan-avian genomic diversity covaries with adaptations to different lifestyles and convergent evolution of traits.				publicationpage, cmec/B-4405-2017; Orlando, Ludovic/A-8932-2013; Jarvis, Erich/A-2319-2008; Mourier, Tobias/C-1164-2015; Fjeldsa, Jon/A-9699-2013; Samaniego Castruita, Jose Alfredo/B-9033-2015; Stadler, Peter F./L-7857-2015; Wang, Jun/C-8434-2016; Pitel, Frederique/C-2847-2009; Hastad, Olle/H-6235-2017; Borges, Rui/H-5873-2016; Burt, David/C-7802-2013; Zepeda Mendoza, Marie Lisandra/C-2001-2015; Romanov, Michael/O-9419-2014; Gilbert, Marcus/A-8936-2013; Campos, Paula/B-1634-2010; Zhang, Guojie/B-6188-2014; Bruford, Michael/D-3750-2009; Scientific output, CIIMAR/E-5122-2012; Alstrom, Per/C-1619-2015; Rahbek, Carsten/L-1129-2013; Schubert, Mikkel/I-6911-2013; publist, CMEC/C-3010-2012; da Fonseca, Rute/F-9143-2013; Wang, Jun/B-9503-2016; Li, Qiye/C-1348-2015	Orlando, Ludovic/0000-0003-3936-1850; Jarvis, Erich/0000-0001-8931-5049; Mourier, Tobias/0000-0003-2727-1903; Fjeldsa, Jon/0000-0003-0790-3600; Samaniego Castruita, Jose Alfredo/0000-0001-5904-1198; Stadler, Peter F./0000-0002-5016-5191; Wang, Jun/0000-0002-8540-8931; Pitel, Frederique/0000-0002-1477-7633; Hastad, Olle/0000-0001-9280-3051; Borges, Rui/0000-0003-3931-9476; Burt, David/0000-0002-9991-1028; Zepeda Mendoza, Marie Lisandra/0000-0002-1126-8219; Romanov, Michael/0000-0003-3584-4644; Gilbert, Marcus/0000-0002-5805-7195; Campos, Paula/0000-0003-1285-4671; Zhang, Guojie/0000-0001-6860-1521; Bruford, Michael/0000-0001-6357-6080; Scientific output, CIIMAR/0000-0001-6270-2153; Alstrom, Per/0000-0001-7182-2763; Schubert, Mikkel/0000-0003-2401-9921; da Fonseca, Rute/0000-0002-2805-4698; Johnson, Warren/0000-0002-5954-186X; /0000-0002-3447-9801; Bertelsen, Mads/0000-0001-9201-7499; Farre, Marta/0000-0001-9170-5767; Hu, Haofu/0000-0001-8145-3009; Almeida, Daniela/0000-0002-9874-933X; Barnett, Ross/0000-0003-4023-0284; Alfaro-Nunez, Alonzo/0000-0002-4050-5041; Braun, Edward/0000-0003-1643-5212; Opazo, Juan/0000-0001-7938-4083; Kim, Heebal/0000-0003-3064-1303; khan, imran/0000-0002-9892-7271; Edwards, Scott/0000-0003-2535-6217; Wang, Jun/0000-0002-2113-5874; Li, Qiye/0000-0002-5993-0312; Cui, Jie/0000-0001-8176-9951; Machado, Joao Paulo/0000-0002-7404-9670; Maldonado, Emanuel/0000-0002-0084-6116; Holmes, Edward/0000-0001-9596-3552; Howard, Jason/0000-0003-3265-5127; Li, Cai/0000-0001-7843-2151; Sunagar, Kartik/0000-0003-0998-1581												0036-8075	1095-9203				DEC 12	2014	346	6215					1311	1320		10.1126/science.1251385								WOS:000346189600035	25504712					J	Xie, YL; Wu, GX; Tang, JB; Luo, RB; Patterson, J; Liu, SL; Huang, WH; He, GZ; Gu, SC; Li, SK; Zhou, X; Lam, TW; Li, YR; Xu, X; Wong, GKS; Wang, J				Xie, Yinlong; Wu, Gengxiong; Tang, Jingbo; Luo, Ruibang; Patterson, Jordan; Liu, Shanlin; Huang, Weihua; He, Guangzhu; Gu, Shengchang; Li, Shengkang; Zhou, Xin; Lam, Tak-Wah; Li, Yingrui; Xu, Xun; Wong, Gane Ka-Shu; Wang, Jun			SOAPdenovo-Trans: de novo transcriptome assembly with short RNA-Seq reads	BIOINFORMATICS					10th Student Council Symposium of the International-Society-for-Computational-Biology (ISCB) held in conjunction with the 22nd Annual Meeting of Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB)	JUL 11, 2014	Boston, MA	Int Soc Computat Biol				Motivation: Transcriptome sequencing has long been the favored method for quickly and inexpensively obtaining a large number of gene sequences from an organism with no reference genome. Owing to the rapid increase in throughputs and decrease in costs of next- generation sequencing, RNA-Seq in particular has become the method of choice. However, the very short reads (e.g. 2 x 90 bp paired ends) from next generation sequencing makes de novo assembly to recover complete or full-length transcript sequences an algorithmic challenge. Results: Here, we present SOAPdenovo-Trans, a de novo transcriptome assembler designed specifically for RNA-Seq. We evaluated its performance on transcriptome datasets from rice and mouse. Using as our benchmarks the known transcripts from these well-annotated genomes (sequenced a decade ago), we assessed how SOAPdenovo-Trans and two other popular transcriptome assemblers handled such practical issues as alternative splicing and variable expression levels. Our conclusion is that SOAPdenovo-Trans provides higher contiguity, lower redundancy and faster execution.

Here we describe the Genome of the Netherlands (GoNL) Project, in which we sequenced the whole genomes of 250 Dutch parent-offspring families and constructed a haplotype map of 20.4 million single-nucleotide variants and 1.2 million insertions and deletions. The intermediate coverage (similar to 13x) and trio design enabled extensive characterization of structural variation, including midsize events (30-500 bp) previously poorly catalogued and de novo mutations. We demonstrate that the quality of the haplotypes boosts imputation accuracy in independent samples, especially for lower frequency alleles. Population genetic analyses demonstrate fine-scale structure across the country and support multiple ancient migrations, consistent with historical changes in sea level and flooding. The GoNL Project illustrates how single-population whole-genome sequencing can provide detailed characterization of genetic variation and may guide the design of future population studies.				de Bakker, Paul/B-8730-2009; Suchiman, H.

Dusko		MetaHIT Consortium	Identification and assembly of genomes and genetic elements in complex metagenomic samples without using reference genomes	NATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY												Most current approaches for analyzing metagenomic data rely on comparisons to reference genomes, but the microbial diversity of many environments extends far beyond what is covered by reference databases. De novo segregation of complex metagenomic data into specific biological entities, such as particular bacterial strains or viruses, remains a largely unsolved problem. Here we present a method, based on binning co-abundant genes across a series of metagenomic samples, that enables comprehensive discovery of new microbial organisms, viruses and co-inherited genetic entities and aids assembly of microbial genomes without the need for reference sequences. We demonstrate the method on data from 396 human gut microbiome samples and identify 7,381 co-abundance gene groups (CAGs), including 741 metagenomic species (MGS). We use these to assemble 238 high-quality microbial genomes and identify affiliations between MGS and hundreds of viruses or genetic entities. Our method provides the means for comprehensive profiling of the diversity within complex metagenomic samples.

These diverse environments are likely to have acted as agents of natural selection and to have led to local adaptations. One of the most celebrated examples in humans is the adaptation of Tibetans to the hypoxic environment of the high-altitude Tibetan plateau(1-3). A hypoxia pathway gene, EPAS1, was previously identified as having the most extreme signature of positive selection in Tibetans(4-10), and was shown to be associated with differences in haemoglobin concentration at high altitude. Re-sequencing the region around EPAS1 in 40 Tibetan and 40 Han individuals, we find that this gene has a highly unusual haplotype structure that can only be convincingly explained by introgression of DNA from Denisovan or Denisovan-related individuals into humans. Scanning a larger set of worldwide populations, we find that the selected haplotype is only found in Denisovans and in Tibetans, and at very low frequency among Han Chinese. Furthermore, the length of the haplotype, and the fact that it is not found in any other populations, makes it unlikely that the haplotype sharing between Tibetans and Denisovans was caused by incomplete ancestral lineage sorting rather than introgression. Our findings illustrate that admixture with other hominin species has provided genetic variation that helped humans to adapt to new environments.

IMPROVE Study Grp; InterAct Consortium	Association between alcohol and cardiovascular disease: Mendelian randomisation analysis based on individual participant data	BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL												Objective To use the rs1229984 variant in the alcohol dehydrogenase 1B gene (ADH1B) as an instrument to investigate the causal role of alcohol in cardiovascular disease. Design Mendelian randomisation meta-analysis of 56 epidemiological studies. Participants 261 991 individuals of European descent, including 20 259 coronary heart disease cases and 10 164 stroke events. Data were available on ADH1B rs1229984 variant, alcohol phenotypes, and cardiovascular biomarkers. Main outcome measures Odds ratio for coronary heart disease and stroke associated with the ADH1B variant in all individuals and by categories of alcohol consumption. Results Carriers of the A-allele of ADH1B rs1229984 consumed 17.2% fewer units of alcohol per week (95% confidence interval 15.6% to 18.9%), had a lower prevalence of binge drinking (odds ratio 0.78 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.84)), and had higher abstention (odds ratio 1.27 (1.21 to 1.34)) than non-carriers. Rs1229984 A-allele carriers had lower systolic blood pressure (-0.88 (-1.19 to -0.56) mm Hg), interleukin-6 levels (-5.2% (-7.8 to -2.4%)), waist circumference (-0.3 (-0.6 to -0.1) cm), and body mass index (-0.17 (-0.24 to -0.10) kg/m(2)). Rs1229984 A-allele carriers had lower odds of coronary heart disease (odds ratio 0.90 (0.84 to 0.96)). The protective association of the ADH1B rs1229984 A-allele variant remained the same across all categories of alcohol consumption (P= 0.83 for heterogeneity). Although no association of rs1229984 was identified with the combined subtypes of stroke, carriers of the A-allele had lower odds of ischaemic stroke (odds ratio 0.83 (0.72 to 0.95)). Conclusions Individuals with a genetic variant associated with non-drinking and lower alcohol consumption had a more favourable cardiovascular profile and a reduced risk of coronary heart disease than those without the genetic variant. This suggests that reduction of alcohol consumption, even for light to moderate drinkers, is beneficial for cardiovascular health.

To better understand the evolution of sex chromosomes and the plasticity of sex-determination mechanisms, we sequenced the whole genomes of a male (ZZ) and a female (ZW) half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis). In addition to insights into adaptation to a benthic lifestyle, we find that the sex chromosomes of these fish are derived from the same ancestral vertebrate protochromosome as the avian W and Z chromosomes. Notably, the same gene on the Z chromosome, dmrt1, which is the male-determining gene in birds, showed convergent evolution of features that are compatible with a similar function in tongue sole. Comparison of the relatively young tongue sole sex chromosomes with those of mammals and birds identified events that occurred during the early phase of sex-chromosome evolution. Pertinent to the current debate about heterogametic sex-chromosome decay, we find that massive gene loss occurred in the wake of sex-chromosome 'birth'.

Examining Illumina HiSeq, Life Technologies SOLiD and Roche 454 platforms at multiple laboratory sites using reference RNA samples with built-in controls, we assess RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) performance for junction discovery and differential expression profiling and compare it to microarray and quantitative PCR (qPCR) data using complementary metrics. At all sequencing depths, we discover unannotated exon-exon junctions, with >80% validated by qPCR. We find that measurements of relative expression are accurate and reproducible across sites and platforms if specific-filters are used. In contrast, RNA-seq and microarrays do not provide accurate absolute measurements, and gene-specific biases are observed for all examined platforms, including qPCR. Measurement performance depends on the platform and data analysis pipeline, and variation is large for transcript-level profiling. The complete SEQC data sets, comprising >100 billion reads (10Tb), provide unique resources for evaluating RNA-seq analyses for clinical and regulatory settings.

Here we present a draft 6.5 Gb genome sequence of Locusta migratoria, which is the largest animal genome sequenced so far. Our findings indicate that the large genome size of L. migratoria is likely to be because of transposable element proliferation combined with slow rates of loss for these elements. Methylome and transcriptome analyses reveal complex regulatory mechanisms involved in microtubule dynamic-mediated synapse plasticity during phase change. We find significant expansion of gene families associated with energy consumption and detoxification, consistent with long-distance flight capacity and phytophagy. We report hundreds of potential insecticide target genes, including cys-loop ligand-gated ion channels, G-protein-coupled receptors and lethal genes. The L. migratoria genome sequence offers new insights into the biology and sustainable management of this pest species, and will promote its wide use as a model system.

Here, we describe how to access the data used in a phylogenomics analysis of the first 85 species, and how to visualize our gene and species trees. Users can develop computational pipelines to analyse these data, in conjunction with data of their own that they can upload. Computationally estimated protein-protein interactions and biochemical pathways can be visualized at another site.

Convergent transcriptional specializations in the brains of humans and song-learning birds	SCIENCE												Song-learning birds and humans share independently evolved similarities in brain pathways for vocal learning that are essential for song and speech and are not found in most other species. Comparisons of brain transcriptomes of song-learning birds and humans relative to vocal nonlearners identified convergent gene expression specializations in specific song and speech brain regions of avian vocal learners and humans. The strongest shared profiles relate bird motor and striatal song-learning nuclei, respectively, with human laryngeal motor cortex and parts of the striatum that control speech production and learning. Most of the associated genes function in motor control and brain connectivity. Thus, convergent behavior and neural connectivity for a complex trait are associated with convergent specialized expression of multiple genes.

The sheep genome illuminates biology of the rumen and lipid metabolism	SCIENCE												Sheep (Ovis aries) are a major source of meat, milk, and fiber in the form of wool and represent a distinct class of animals that have a specialized digestive organ, the rumen, that carries out the initial digestion of plant material. We have developed and analyzed a high-quality reference sheep genome and transcriptomes from 40 different tissues. We identified highly expressed genes encoding keratin cross-linking proteins associated with rumen evolution. We also identified genes involved in lipid metabolism that had been amplified and/or had altered tissue expression patterns. This may be in response to changes in the barrier lipids of the skin, an interaction between lipid metabolism and wool synthesis, and an increased role of volatile fatty acids in ruminants compared with nonruminant animals.

Motivated by this, we performed association mapping of T2D-related quantitative traits in up to 2,575 Greenlandic individuals without known diabetes. Using array-based genotyping and exome sequencing, we discovered a nonsense p.Arg684Ter variant (in which arginine is replaced by a termination codon) in the gene TBC1D4 with an allele frequency of 17%. Here we show that homozygous carriers of this variant have markedly higher concentrations of plasma glucose(beta=3.8 mmol l(-1), P = 2.5 X 10(-35)) and serum insulin (beta = 165 pmol l(-1), P = 1.5 X 10(-20)) 2 hours after an oral glucose load compared with individuals with other genotypes (both non-carriers and heterozygous carriers). Furthermore, homozygous carriers have marginally lower concentrations of fasting plasma glucose (beta = -0.18 mmol l(-1), P = 1.1 X 10(-6)) and fasting serum insulin (beta = -8.3 pmol l(-1), P = 0.0014), and their T2D risk is markedly increased (odds ratio (OR) = 10.3, P = 1.6 X 10(-24)). Heterozygous carriers have a moderately higher plasma glucose concentration 2 hours after an oral glucose load than non-carriers (beta = 0.43 mmol l(-1), P = 5.3 X 10(-5)). Analyses of skeletal muscle biopsies showed lower messenger RNA and protein levels of the long isoform of TBC1D4, and lower muscle protein levels of the glucose transporter GLUT4, with increasing number of p.Arg684Ter alleles. These findings are concomitant with a severely decreased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in muscle, leading to postprandial hyperglycaemia, impaired glucose tolerance and T2D. The observed effect sizes are several times larger than any previous findings in large-scale genome-wide association studies of these traits(2-4) and constitute further proof of the value of conducting genetic association studies outside the traditional setting of large homogeneous populations.

Ronald			Interplay between FGF21 and insulin action in the liver regulates metabolism	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION												The hormone FGF21 regulates carbohydrate and lipid homeostasis as well as body weight, and increasing FGF21 improves metabolic abnormalities associated with obesity and diabetes. FGF21 is thought to act on its target tissues, including liver and adipose tissue, to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce adiposity. Here, we used mice with selective hepatic inactivation of the IR (LIRKO) to determine whether insulin sensitization in liver mediates FGF21 metabolic actions. Remarkably, hyperglycemia was completely normalized following FGF21 treatment in LIRKO mice, even though FGF21 did not reduce gluconeogenesis in these animals. Improvements in blood sugar were due in part to increased glucose uptake in brown fat, browning of white fat, and overall increased energy expenditure. These effects were preserved even after removal of the main interscapular brown fat pad. In contrast to its retained effects on reducing glucose levels, the effects of FGF21 on reducing circulating cholesterol and hepatic triglycerides and regulating the expression of key genes involved in cholesterol and lipid metabolism in liver were disrupted in LIRKO mice. Thus, FGF21 corrects hyperglycemia in diabetic mice independently of insulin action in the liver by increasing energy metabolism via activation of brown fat and browning of white fat, but intact liver insulin action is required for FGF21 to control hepatic lipid metabolism.

We performed whole-exome sequencing of 49 blood-tumor pairs and RNA sequencing of 44 tumors from cortisol-producing adrenocortical adenomas (ACAs), adrenocorticotropic hormone-independent macronodular adrenocortical hyperplasias (AIMAHs), and adrenocortical oncocytomas (ADOs). We identified a hotspot in the PRKACA gene with a L205R mutation in 69.2%(27 out of 39) of ACAs and validated in 65.5% of a total of 87 ACAs. Our data revealed that the activating L205R mutation, which locates in the P+1 loop of the protein kinase A (PKA) catalytic subunit, promoted PKA substrate phosphorylation and target gene expression. Moreover, we discovered the recurrently mutated gene DOT1L in AIMAHs and CLASP2 in ADOs. Collectively, these data highlight potentially functional mutated genes in adrenal Cushing's syndrome.

By sequencing transcriptonnes of low- and high-risk neuroblastomas, we detected differentially expressed annotated and nonannotated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). We identified a lncRNA neuroblastoma associated transcript-1 (NBAT-1) as a biomarker significantly predicting clinical outcome of neuroblastoma. CpG methylation and a high-risk neuroblastoma associated SNP on chromosome 6p22 functionally contribute to NBAT-1 differential expression. Loss of NBAT-1 increases cellular proliferation and invasion. It controls these processes via epigenetic silencing of target genes. NBAT-1 loss affects neuronal differentiation through activation of the neuronal-specific transcription factor NRSF/REST. Thus, loss of NBAT-1 contributes to aggressive neuroblastoma by increasing proliferation and impairing differentiation of neuronal precursors.

Here we sequence the genome and stage-specific transcriptomes of the dampwood termite Zootermopsis nevadensis (Blattodea) and compare them with similar data for eusocial Hymenoptera, to better identify commonalities and differences in achieving this significant transition. We show an expansion of genes related to male fertility, with upregulated gene expression in male reproductive individuals reflecting the profound differences in mating biology relative to the Hymenoptera. For several chemoreceptor families, we show divergent numbers of genes, which may correspond to the more claustral lifestyle of these termites. We also show similarities in the number and expression of genes related to caste determination mechanisms. Finally, patterns of DNA methylation and alternative splicing support a hypothesized epigenetic regulation of caste differentiation.

We performed whole-genome sequencing to evaluate the mutational load at single-base resolution in individual gene-corrected human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) clones in three different disease models. In single-cell clones, gene correction by helper-dependent adenoviral vector (HDAdV) or Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nuclease (TALEN) exhibited few off-target effects and a low level of sequence variation, comparable to that accumulated in routine hiPSC culture. The sequence variants were randomly distributed and unique to individual clones. We also combined both technologies and developed a TALEN-HDAdV hybrid vector, which significantly increased gene-correction efficiency in hiPSCs. Therefore, with careful monitoring via whole-genome sequencing it is possible to apply genome editing to human pluripotent cells with minimal impact on genomic mutational load.

Outbreaks of it have re-occurred approximately every three years in Asia. It has also been used as a model system for ecological studies and for developing effective pest management. To better understand how a monophagous sap-sucking arthropod herbivore has adapted to its exclusive host selection and to provide insights to improve pest control, we analyzed the genomes of the brown planthopper and its two endosymbionts. Results: We describe the 1.14 gigabase planthopper draft genome and the genomes of two microbial endosymbionts that permit the planthopper to forage exclusively on rice fields. Only 40.8% of the 27,571 identified Nilaparvata protein coding genes have detectable shared homology with the proteomes of the other 14 arthropods included in this study, reflecting large-scale gene losses including in evolutionarily conserved gene families and biochemical pathways. These unique genomic features are functionally associated with the animal's exclusive plant host selection. Genes missing from the insect in conserved biochemical pathways that are essential for its survival on the nutritionally imbalanced sap diet are present in the genomes of its microbial endosymbionts, which have evolved to complement the mutualistic nutritional needs of the host. Conclusions: Our study reveals a series of complex adaptations of the brown planthopper involving a variety of biological processes, that result in its highly destructive impact on the exclusive host rice. All these findings highlight potential directions for effective pest control of the planthopper.

We analyzed 89 complete genomes of polar bear and brown bear using population genomic modeling and show that the species diverged only 479-343 thousand years BP. We find that genes on the polar bear lineage have been under stronger positive selection than in brown bears; nine of the top 16 genes under strong positive selection are associated with cardiomyopathy and vascular disease, implying important reorganization of the cardiovascular system. One of the genes showing the strongest evidence of selection, APOB, encodes the primary lipoprotein component of low-density lipoprotein (LDL); functional mutations in APOB may explain how polar bears are able to cope with life-long elevated LDL levels that are associated with high risk of heart disease in humans.

Three crocodilian genomes reveal ancestral patterns of evolution among archosaurs	SCIENCE												To provide context for the diversification of archosaurs-the group that includes crocodilians, dinosaurs, and birds-we generated draft genomes of three crocodilians: Alligator mississippiensis (the American alligator), Crocodylus porosus (the saltwater crocodile), and Gavialis gangeticus (the Indian gharial). We observed an exceptionally slow rate of genome evolution within crocodilians at all levels, including nucleotide substitutions, indels, transposable element content and movement, gene family evolution, and chromosomal synteny. When placed within the context of related taxa including birds and turtles, this suggests that the common ancestor of all of these taxa also exhibited slow genome evolution and that the comparatively rapid evolution is derived in birds. The data also provided the opportunity to analyze heterozygosity in crocodilians, which indicates a likely reduction in population size for all three taxa through the Pleistocene. Finally, these data combined with newly published bird genomes allowed us to reconstruct the partial genome of the common ancestor of archosaurs, thereby providing a tool to investigate the genetic starting material of crocodilians, birds, and dinosaurs.

Here we present the assembled genome of the social velvet spider and a draft assembly of the tarantula genome that represent two major taxonomic groups of spiders. The spider genomes are large with short exons and long introns, reminiscent of mammalian genomes. Phylogenetic analyses place spiders and ticks as sister groups supporting polyphyly of the Acari. Complex sets of venom and silk genes/proteins are identified. We find that venom genes evolved by sequential duplication, and that the toxic effect of venom is most likely activated by proteases present in the venom. The set of silk genes reveals a highly dynamic gene evolution, new types of silk genes and proteins, and a novel use of aciniform silk. These insights create new opportunities for pharmacological applications of venom and biomaterial applications of silk.

Three new reference genomes were reconstructed to support our comparative genome analyses. Comparative sequence alignment revealed group-, species- and accession-specific polymorphisms, explaining characteristic fruit traits and growth habits in the various cultivars. Using gene models from the annotated Heinz 1706 reference genome, we observed differences in the ratio between non-synonymous and synonymous SNPs (dN/dS) in fruit diversification and plant growth genes compared to a random set of genes, indicating positive selection and differences in selection pressure between crop accessions and wild species. In wild species, the number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) exceeds 10million, i.e. 20-fold higher than found in most of the crop accessions, indicating dramatic genetic erosion of crop and heirloom tomatoes. In addition, the highest levels of heterozygosity were found for allogamous self-incompatible wild species, while facultative and autogamous self-compatible species display a lower heterozygosity level. Using whole-genome SNP information for maximum-likelihood analysis, we achieved complete tree resolution, whereas maximum-likelihood trees based on SNPs from ten fruit and growth genes show incomplete resolution for the crop accessions, partly due to the effect of heterozygous SNPs. Finally, results suggest that phylogenetic relationships are correlated with habitat, indicating the occurrence of geographical races within these groups, which is of practical importance for Solanum genome evolution studies.

Dynamic reassortments and genetic heterogeneity of the human-infecting influenza A (H7N9) virus	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Influenza A (H7N9) virus has been causing human infections in China since February 2013, raising serious concerns of potential pandemics. Previous studies demonstrate that human infection is directly linked to live animal markets, and that the internal genes of the virus are derived from H9N2 viruses circulating in the Yangtze River Delta area in Eastern China. Here following analysis of 109 viruses, we show a much higher genetic heterogeneity of the H7N9 viruses than previously reported, with a total of 27 newly designated genotypes. Phylogenetic and genealogical inferences reveal that genotypes G0 and G2.6 dominantly co-circulate within poultry, with most human isolates belonging to the genotype G0. G0 viruses are also responsible for the inter-and intra-province transmissions, leading to the genesis of novel genotypes. These observations suggest the province-specific H9N2 virus gene pools increase the genetic diversity of H7N9 via dynamic reassortments and also imply that G0 has not gained overwhelming fitness and the virus continues to undergo reassortment.

Here we report the whole-genome sequencing and de novo assembly of the minke whale genome, as well as the whole-genome sequences of three minke whales, a fin whale, a bottlenose dolphin and a finless porpoise. Our comparative genomic analysis identified an expansion in the whale lineage of gene families associated with stress-responsive proteins and anaerobic metabolism, whereas gene families related to body hair and sensory receptors were contracted. Our analysis also identified whale-specific mutations in genes encoding antioxidants and enzymes controlling blood pressure and salt concentration. Overall the whale-genome sequences exhibited distinct features that are associated with the physiological and morphological changes needed for life in an aquatic environment, marked by resistance to physiological stresses caused by a lack of oxygen, increased amounts of reactive oxygen species and high salt levels.

The Genome of the Netherlands: design, and project goals	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS												Within the Netherlands a national network of biobanks has been established (Biobanking and Biomolecular Research Infrastructure-Netherlands (BBMRI-NL)) as a national node of the European BBMRI. One of the aims of BBMRI-NL is to enrich biobanks with different types of molecular and phenotype data. Here, we describe the Genome of the Netherlands (GoNL), one of the projects within BBMRI-NL. GoNL is a whole-genome-sequencing project in a representative sample consisting of 250 trio-families from all provinces in the Netherlands, which aims to characterize DNA sequence variation in the Dutch population. The parent-offspring trios include adult individuals ranging in age from 19 to 87 years (mean = 53 years; SD = 16 years) from birth cohorts 1910-1994. Sequencing was done on blood-derived DNA from uncultured cells and accomplished coverage was 14-15x. The family-based design represents a unique resource to assess the frequency of regional variants, accurately reconstruct haplotypes by family-based phasing, characterize short indels and complex structural variants, and establish the rate of de novo mutational events. GoNL will also serve as a reference panel for imputation in the available genome-wide association studies in Dutch and other cohorts to refine association signals and uncover population-specific variants. GoNL will create a catalog of human genetic variation in this sample that is uniquely characterized with respect to micro-geographic location and a wide range of phenotypes. The resource will be made available to the research and medical community to guide the interpretation of sequencing projects. The present paper summarizes the global characteristics of the project.				Suchiman, H.

However, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based implementation is biased by the efficiency of primer binding across lineages of organisms. A PCR-free HTS approach will alleviate this artefact and significantly improve upon the multi-locus method utilizing full mitogenomes. Here we developed a novel multiplex sequencing and assembly pipeline allowing for simultaneous acquisition of full mitogenomes from pooled animals without DNA enrichment or amplification. By concatenating assemblies from three de novo assemblers, we obtained high-quality mitogenomes for all 49 pooled taxa, with 36 species > 15 kb and the remaining > 10 kb, including 20 complete mitogenomes and nearly all protein coding genes (99.6%). The assembly quality was carefully validated with Sanger sequences, reference genomes and conservativeness of protein coding genes across taxa. The new method was effective even for closely related taxa, e. g. three Drosophila spp., demonstrating its broad utility for biodiversity research and mito-phylogenomics. Finally, the in silico simulation showed that by recruiting multiple mito-loci, taxon detection was improved at a fixed sequencing depth. Combined, these results demonstrate the plausibility of a multi-locus mito-metagenomics approach as the next phase of the current single-locus metabarcoding method.

Although epigenetic regulation in response to environmental effects has long been proposed to be associated with ESD, a systemic analysis on epigenetic regulation of ESD is still lacking. Using half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) as a model-a marine fish that has both ZW chromosomal GSD and temperature-dependent ESD-we investigated the role of DNA methylation in transition from GSD to ESD. Comparative analysis of the gonadal DNA methylomes of pseudomale, female, and normal male fish revealed that genes in the sex determination pathways are the major targets of substantial methylation modification during sexual reversal. Methylation modification in pseudomales is globally inherited in their ZW offspring, which can naturally develop into pseudomales without temperature incubation. Transcriptome analysis revealed that dosage compensation occurs in a restricted, methylated cytosine enriched Z chromosomal region in pseudomale testes, achieving equal expression level in normal male testes. In contrast, female-specific W chromosomal genes are suppressed in pseudomales by methylation regulation. We conclude that epigenetic regulation plays multiple crucial roles in sexual reversal of tongue sole fish. We also offer the first clues on the mechanisms behind gene dosage balancing in an organism that undergoes sexual reversal. Finally, we suggest a causal link between the bias sex chromosome assortment in the offspring of a pseudomale family and the transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of sexual reversal in tongue sole fish.

How eastern oysters without adaptive immunity survive in pathogen-rich environments is of fundamental interest, but studies on its immune system are hindered by the lack of genomic resources. We sequenced the transcriptome of an adult oyster with short Illumina reads and assembled 66,229 contigs with a N50 length of 1,503 bp. The assembly covered 89.4 % of published ESTs and 97.9 % of mitochondrial genes demonstrating its quality. A set of 39,978 contigs and unigenes (> 300 bp) were identified and annotated by searching public databases. Analysis of the gene set yielded a diverse set of 657 genes related to innate immunity, including many pertaining to pattern recognition, effectors, signal transduction, cytokines, and apoptosis. Gene families encoding C1q domain containing proteins, CTLD, IAPs, Ig_I-set, and TRAFs expanded in C. virginica and Crassostrea gigas. Many key genes of the apoptosis system including IAP, BAX, BAC-2, caspase, FADD, and TNFR were identified, suggesting C. virginica posses advanced apoptosis and apoptosis-regulating systems. Our results show that short Illumina reads can produce transcriptomes of highly polymorphic genomes with coverage and integrity comparable to that from longer 454 reads. The expansion and high diversity in gene families related to innate immunity, point to a complex defense system in the lophotrochozoan C. virginica, probably in adaptation to a pathogen-rich environment.

Worryingly, the incidence of human infections caused by third-generation cephalosporin-resistant E. coli is increasing worldwide. Recent studies have suggested that these E. coli strains, and their antibiotic resistance genes, can spread from food-producing animals, via the food-chain, to humans. However, these studies used traditional typing methods, which may not have provided sufficient resolution to reliably assess the relatedness of these strains. We therefore used whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to study the relatedness of cephalosporin-resistant E. coli from humans, chicken meat, poultry and pigs. One strain collection included pairs of human and poultry-associated strains that had previously been considered to be identical based on Multi-Locus Sequence Typing, plasmid typing and antibiotic resistance gene sequencing. The second collection included isolates from farmers and their pigs. WGS analysis revealed considerable heterogeneity between human and poultry-associated isolates. The most closely related pairs of strains from both sources carried 1263 Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) per Mbp core genome. In contrast, epidemiologically linked strains from humans and pigs differed by only 1.8 SNPs per Mbp core genome. WGS-based plasmid reconstructions revealed three distinct plasmid lineages (IncI1- and IncK-type) that carried cephalosporin resistance genes of the Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) -and AmpC-types. The plasmid backbones within each lineage were virtually identical and were shared by genetically unrelated human and animal isolates. Plasmid reconstructions from short-read sequencing data were validated by long-read DNA sequencing for two strains. Our findings failed to demonstrate evidence for recent clonal transmission of cephalosporin-resistant E. coli strains from poultry to humans, as has been suggested based on traditional, low-resolution typing methods. Instead, our data suggest that cephalosporin resistance genes are mainly disseminated in animals and humans via distinct plasmids.

Here we sequence and assemble a draft genome of wild soybean and construct a recombinant inbred population for genotyping-by-sequencing and phenotypic analyses to identify multiple QTLs relevant to traits of interest in agriculture. We use a combination of de novo sequencing data from this work and our previous germplasm re-sequencing data to identify a novel ion transporter gene, GmCHX1, and relate its sequence alterations to salt tolerance. Rapid gain-of-function tests show the protective effects of GmCHX1 towards salt stress. This combination of whole-genome de novo sequencing, high-density-marker QTL mapping by re-sequencing and functional analyses can serve as an effective strategy to unveil novel genomic information in wild soybean to facilitate crop improvement.

We discovered two independent missense SNVs in IL23R and GJB2 of low frequency and five common missense SNVs in LCE3D, ERAP1, CARD14 and ZNF816A associated with psoriasis at genome-wide significance. Rare missense SNVs in FUT2 and TARBP1 were also observed with suggestive evidence of association. Single-variant and gene-based association analyses of nonsynonymous SNVs did not identify newly associated genes for psoriasis in the regions subjected to targeted resequencing. This suggests that coding variants in the 1,326 targeted genes contribute only a limited fraction of the overall genetic risk for psoriasis.

Immature truncated O-glycophenotype of cancer directly induces oncogenic features	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Aberrant expression of immature truncated O-glycans is a characteristic feature observed on virtually all epithelial cancer cells, and a very high frequency is observed in early epithelial premalignant lesions that precede the development of adenocarcinomas. Expression of the truncated O-glycan structures Tn and sialyl-Tn is strongly associated with poor prognosis and overall low survival. The genetic and bio-synthetic mechanisms leading to accumulation of truncated O-glycans are not fully understood and include mutation or dysregulation of glycosyltransferases involved in elongation of O-glycans, as well as relocation of glycosyltransferases controlling initiation of O-glycosylation from Golgi to endoplasmic reticulum. Truncated O-glycans have been proposed to play functional roles for cancer-cell invasiveness, but our understanding of the biological functions of aberrant glycosylation in cancer is still highly limited. Here, we used exome sequencing of most glycosyltransferases in a large series of primary and metastatic pancreatic cancers to rule out somatic mutations as a cause of expression of truncated O-glycans. Instead, we found hypermethylation of core 1 beta 3-Gal-T-specific molecular chaperone, a key chaperone for O-glycan elongation, as the most prevalent cause. We next used gene editing to produce isogenic cell systems with and without homogenous truncated O-glycans that enabled, to our knowledge, the first polyomic and side-by-side evaluation of the cancer O-glycophenotype in an organotypic tissue model and in xenografts. The results strongly suggest that truncation of O-glycans directly induces oncogenic features of cell growth and invasion. The study provides support for targeting cancer-specific truncated O-glycans with immunotherapeutic measures.

Here we use whole-genome resequencing of six 293 cell lines to study the dynamics of this aneuploid genome in response to the manipulations used to generate common 293 cell derivatives, such as transformation and stable clone generation (293T); suspension growth adaptation (293S); and cytotoxic lectin selection (293SG). Remarkably, we observe that copy number alteration detection could identify the genomic region that enabled cell survival under selective conditions (i.c. ricin selection). Furthermore, we present methods to detect human/vector genome breakpoints and a user-friendly visualization tool for the 293 genome data. We also establish that the genome structure composition is in steady state for most of these cell lines when standard cell culturing conditions are used. This resource enables novel and more informed studies with 293 cells, and we will distribute the sequenced cell lines to this effect.

Horizontal transfer of an adaptive chimeric photoreceptor from bryophytes to ferns	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Ferns are well known for their shade-dwelling habits. Their ability to thrive under low-light conditions has been linked to the evolution of a novel chimeric photoreceptor-neochrome-that fuses red-sensing phytochrome and blue-sensing phototropin modules into a single gene, thereby optimizing phototropic responses. Despite being implicated in facilitating the diversification of modern ferns, the origin of neochrome has remained a mystery. We present evidence for neochrome in hornworts (a bryophyte lineage) and demonstrate that ferns acquired neochrome from hornworts via horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Fern neochromes are nested within hornwort neochromes in our large-scale phylogenetic reconstructions of phototropin and phytochrome gene families. Divergence date estimates further support the HGT hypothesis, with fern and hornwort neochromes diverging 179 Mya, long after the split between the two plant lineages (at least 400 Mya). By analyzing the draft genome of the hornwort Anthoceros punctatus, we also discovered a previously unidentified phototropin gene that likely represents the ancestral lineage of the neochrome phototropin module. Thus, a neochrome originating in hornworts was transferred horizontally to ferns, where it may have played a significant role in the diversification of modern ferns.

Deep Sequencing of RNA from Three Different Extracellular Vesicle (EV) Subtypes Released from the Human LIM1863 Colon Cancer Cell Line Uncovers Distinct Mirna-Enrichment Signatures	PLOS ONE												Secreted microRNAs (miRNAs) enclosed within extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a pivotal role in intercellular communication by regulating recipient cell gene expression and affecting target cell function. Here, we report the isolation of three distinct EV subtypes from the human colon carcinoma cell line LIM1863-shed microvesicles (sMVs) and two exosome populations (immunoaffinity isolated A33-exosomes and EpCAM-exosomes). Deep sequencing of miRNA libraries prepared from parental LIM1863 cells/derived EV subtype RNA yielded 254 miRNA identifications, of which 63 are selectively enriched in the EVs-miR-19a/b-3p, miR-378a/c/d, and miR-577 and members of the let-7 and miR-8 families being the most prominent. Let-7a-3p*, let-7f-1-3p*, miR-451a, miR-574-5p*, miR-4454 and miR-7641 are common to all EV subtypes, and 6 miRNAs (miR-320a/b/c/d, miR-221-3p, and miR-200c-3p) discern LIM1863 exosomes from sMVs; miR-98-5p was selectively represented only in sMVs. Notably, A33-Exos contained the largest number (32) of exclusively-enriched miRNAs; 14 of these miRNAs have not been reported in the context of CRC tissue/biofluid analyses and warrant further examination as potential diagnostic markers of CRC. Surprisingly, miRNA passenger strands (star miRNAs) for miR-3613-3p*, -362-3p*, -625-3p*, -6842-3p* were the dominant strand in A33-Exos, the converse to that observed in parental cells. This finding suggests miRNA biogenesis may be interlinked with endosomal/exosomal processing.

Genome-wide single-generation signatures of local selection in the panmictic European eel	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Next-generation sequencing and the collection of genome-wide data allow identifying adaptive variation and footprints of directional selection. Using a large SNP data set from 259 RAD-sequenced European eel individuals (glass eels) from eight locations between 34 and 64(o)N, we examined the patterns of genome-wide genetic diversity across locations. We tested for local selection by searching for increased population differentiation using F-ST-based outlier tests and by testing for significant associations between allele frequencies and environmental variables. The overall low genetic differentiation found (F-ST=0.0007) indicates that most of the genome is homogenized by gene flow, providing further evidence for genomic panmixia in the European eel. The lack of genetic substructuring was consistent at both nuclear and mitochondrial SNPs. Using an extensive number of diagnostic SNPs, results showed a low occurrence of hybrids between European and American eel, mainly limited to Iceland (5.9%), although individuals with signatures of introgression several generations back in time were found in mainland Europe. Despite panmixia, a small set of SNPs showed high genetic differentiation consistent with single-generation signatures of spatially varying selection acting on glass eels. After screening 50354 SNPs, a total of 754 potentially locally selected SNPs were identified. Candidate genes for local selection constituted a wide array of functions, including calcium signalling, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and circadian rhythm. Remarkably, one of the candidate genes identified is PERIOD, possibly related to differences in local photoperiod associated with the >30 degrees difference in latitude between locations. Genes under selection were spread across the genome, and there were no large regions of increased differentiation as expected when selection occurs within just a single generation due to panmixia. This supports the conclusion that most of the genome is homogenized by gene flow that removes any effects of diversifying selection from each new generation.

Thomas P.; Zhang, Guojie			Complex evolutionary trajectories of sex chromosomes across bird taxa	SCIENCE												Sex-specific chromosomes, like the W of most female birds and the Y of male mammals, usually have lost most genes owing to a lack of recombination. We analyze newly available genomes of 17 bird species representing the avian phylogenetic range, and find that more than half of them do not have as fully degenerated W chromosomes as that of chicken. We show that avian sex chromosomes harbor tremendous diversity among species in their composition of pseudoautosomal regions and degree of Z/W differentiation. Punctuated events of shared or lineage-specific recombination suppression have produced a gradient of "evolutionary strata" along the Z chromosome, which initiates from the putative avian sex-determining gene DMRT1 and ends at the pseudoautosomal region. W-linked genes are subject to ongoing functional decay after recombination was suppressed, and the tempo of degeneration slows down in older strata. Overall, we unveil a complex history of avian sex chromosome evolution.

Live poultry markets were suspected locations of the human H7N9 infection sources, based on the cases' exposure histories and sequence similarities between viral isolates. To explore the role of live poultry markets in the origin of the novel H7N9 virus, we systematically examined poultry and environmental specimens from local markets and farms in Hangzhou, using real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) as well as high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS). RT-PCR identified specimens positive for the H7 and N9 genomic segments in all of the 12 poultry markets epidemiologically linked to 10 human H7N9 cases. Chickens, ducks, and environmental specimens from the markets contained heavily mixed subtypes, including H7, N9, H9, and N2 and sometimes H5 and Ni. The idea of the coexistence of H7N9 and H9N2 subtypes in chickens was further supported by metagenomic sequencing. In contrast, human H7N9 infection cases (n = 31) were all negative for H9N2 virus according to real-time RT-PCR. The six internal segments were indistinguishable for the H7N9 and H9N2 viruses. The H9, N2, and internal-segment sequences were very close to the sequence of the H9N2 virus circulating in chickens in China recently. Our results provide direct evidence that H9N2 strains coexisted with the novel human-pathogenic H7N9 influenza virus in epidemiologically linked live poultry markets. Avian influenza A virus of the H9N2 subtype likely made a recent contribution to the evolution of the H7N9 virus and continues to do so.

The 3,000 rice genomes project: new opportunities and challenges for future rice research	GIGASCIENCE												Rice is the world's most important staple grown by millions of small-holder farmers. Sustaining rice production relies on the intelligent use of rice diversity. The 3,000 Rice Genomes Project is a giga-dataset of publically available genome sequences (averaging 14x depth of coverage) derived from 3,000 accessions of rice with global representation of genetic and functional diversity. The seed of these accessions is available from the International Rice Genebank Collection. Together, they are an unprecedented resource for advancing rice science and breeding technology. Our immediate challenge now is to comprehensively and systematically mine this dataset to link genotypic variation to functional variation with the ultimate goal of creating new and sustainable rice varieties that can support a future world population that will approach 9.6 billion by 2050.

Base pair differences arising from SVs are on a much higher order (>100 fold) than point mutations; however, none of the current detection methods are comprehensive, and currently available methodologies are incapable of providing sufficient resolution and unambiguous information across complex regions in the human genome. To address these challenges, we applied a high-throughput, cost-effective genome mapping technology to comprehensively discover genome-wide SVs and characterize complex regions of the YH genome using long single molecules (>150 kb) in a global fashion. Results: Utilizing nanochannel-based genome mapping technology, we obtained 708 insertions/deletions and 17 inversions larger than 1 kb. Excluding the 59 SVs (54 insertions/deletions, 5 inversions) that overlap with N-base gaps in the reference assembly hg19, 666 non-gap SVs remained, and 396 of them (60%) were verified by paired-end data from whole-genome sequencing-based re-sequencing or de novo assembly sequence from fosmid data. Of the remaining 270 SVs, 260 are insertions and 213 overlap known SVs in the Database of Genomic Variants. Overall, 609 out of 666 (90%) variants were supported by experimental orthogonal methods or historical evidence in public databases. At the same time, genome mapping also provides valuable information for complex regions with haplotypes in a straightforward fashion. In addition, with long single-molecule labeling patterns, exogenous viral sequences were mapped on a whole-genome scale, and sample heterogeneity was analyzed at a new level. Conclusion: Our study highlights genome mapping technology as a comprehensive and cost-effective method for detecting structural variation and studying complex regions in the human genome, as well as deciphering viral integration into the host genome.

The Opisthorchis viverrini genome provides insights into life in the bile duct	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Opisthorchiasis is a neglected, tropical disease caused by the carcinogenic Asian liver fluke, Opisthorchis viverrini. This hepatobiliary disease is linked to malignant cancer (cholangiocarcinoma, CCA) and affects millions of people in Asia. No vaccine is available, and only one drug (praziquantel) is used against the parasite. Little is known about O. viverrini biology and the diseases that it causes. Here we characterize the draft genome (634.5 Mb) and transcriptomes of O. viverrini, elucidate how this fluke survives in the hostile environment within the bile duct and show that metabolic pathways in the parasite are highly adapted to a lipid-rich diet from bile and/or cholangiocytes. We also provide additional evidence that O. viverrini and other flukes secrete proteins that directly modulate host cell proliferation. Our molecular resources now underpin profound explorations of opisthorchiasis/CCA and the design of new interventions.

MuTHER Consortium	Differential methylation of the TRPA1 promoter in pain sensitivity	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Chronic pain is a global public health problem, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Here we examine genome-wide DNA methylation, first in 50 identical twins discordant for heat pain sensitivity and then in 50 further unrelated individuals. Whole-blood DNA methylation was characterized at 5.2 million loci by MeDIP sequencing and assessed longitudinally to identify differentially methylated regions associated with high or low pain sensitivity (pain DMRs). Nine meta-analysis pain DMRs show robust evidence for association (false discovery rate 5%) with the strongest signal in the pain gene TRPA1 (P = 1.2 x 10(-13)). Several pain DMRs show longitudinal stability consistent with susceptibility effects, have similar methylation levels in the brain and altered expression in the skin. Our approach identifies epigenetic changes in both novel and established candidate genes that provide molecular insights into pain and may generalize to other complex traits.

Non-invasive prenatal testing for fetal chromosomal abnormalities by low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of maternal plasma DNA: review of 1982 consecutive cases in a single center	ULTRASOUND IN OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY												Objective To review the performance of non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) by low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of maternal plasma DNA at a single center. Methods The NIPT result and pregnancy outcome of 1982 consecutive cases were reviewed. NIPT was based on low coverage (0.1x) whole-genome sequencing of maternal plasma DNA. All subjects were contacted for pregnancy and fetal outcome. Results Of the 1982 NIPT tests, a repeat blood sample was required in 23 (1.16%). In one case, a conclusive report could not be issued, probably because of an abnormal vanished twin fetus. NIPT was positive for common trisomies in 29 cases (23 were trisomy 21, four were trisomy 18 and two were trisomy 13); all were confirmed by prenatal karyotyping (specificity=100%). In addition, 11 cases were positive for sex-chromosomal abnormalities (SCA), and nine cases were positive for other aneuploidies or deletion/duplication. Fourteen of these 20 subjects agreed to undergo further investigations, and the abnormality was found to be of fetal origin in seven, confined placental mosaicism (CPM) in four, of maternal origin in two and not confirmed in one. Overall, 85.7% of the NIPT-suspected SCA were of fetal origin, and 66.7% of the other abnormalities were caused by CPM. Two of the six cases suspected or confirmed to have CPM were complicated by early-onset growth restriction requiring delivery before 34 weeks. Fetal outcome of the NIPT-negative cases was ascertained in 1645 (85.15%). Three chromosomal abnormalities were not detected by NIPT, including one case each of a balanced translocation, unbalanced translocation and triploidy. There were no known false negatives involving the common trisomies (sensitivity=100%). Conclusions Low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of maternal plasma DNA was highly accurate in detecting common trisomies. It also enabled the detection of other aneuploidies and structural chromosomal abnormalities with high positive predictive value. Copyright (C) 2013 ISUOG.

Changes affecting their function can yield novel life forms but may also have deleterious effects. Consequently, gene duplication events that release one gene copy from selective pressure are thought to be the common mechanism by which TFs acquire new activities. Here, we show that LEAFY, a major regulator of flower development and cell division in land plants, underwent changes to its DNA binding specificity, even though plant genomes generally contain a single copy of the LEAFY gene. We examined how these changes occurred at the structural level and identify an intermediate LEAFY form in hornworts that appears to adopt all different specificities. This promiscuous intermediate could have smoothed the evolutionary transitions, thereby allowing LEAFY to evolve new binding specificities while remaining a single-copy gene.

However, the molecular biology of sesame is largely unexplored. Results: Here, we report a high-quality genome sequence of sesame assembled de novo with a contig N50 of 52.2 kb and a scaffold N50 of 2.1 Mb, containing an estimated 27,148 genes. The results reveal novel, independent whole genome duplication and the absence of the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain in resistance genes. Candidate genes and oil biosynthetic pathways contributing to high oil content were discovered by comparative genomic and transcriptomic analyses. These revealed the expansion of type 1 lipid transfer genes by tandem duplication, the contraction of lipid degradation genes, and the differential expression of essential genes in the triacylglycerol biosynthesis pathway, particularly in the early stage of seed development. Resequencing data in 29 sesame accessions from 12 countries suggested that the high genetic diversity of lipid-related genes might be associated with the wide variation in oil content. Additionally, the results shed light on the pivotal stage of seed development, oil accumulation and potential key genes for sesamin production, an important pharmacological constituent of sesame. Conclusions: As an important species from the order Lamiales and a high oil crop, the sesame genome will facilitate future research on the evolution of eudicots, as well as the study of lipid biosynthesis and potential genetic improvement of sesame.

Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of multiple individuals reveals complementary roles of promoter and gene body methylation in transcriptional regulation	GENOME BIOLOGY												Background: DNA methylation is an important type of epigenetic modification involved in gene regulation. Although strong DNA methylation at promoters is widely recognized to be associated with transcriptional repression, many aspects of DNA methylation remain not fully understood, including the quantitative relationships between DNA methylation and expression levels, and the individual roles of promoter and gene body methylation. Results: Here we present an integrated analysis of whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and RNA sequencing data from human samples and cell lines. We find that while promoter methylation inversely correlates with gene expression as generally observed, the repressive effect is clear only on genes with a very high DNA methylation level. By means of statistical modeling, we find that DNA methylation is indicative of the expression class of a gene in general, but gene body methylation is a better indicator than promoter methylation. These findings are general in that a model constructed from a sample or cell line could accurately fit the unseen data from another. We further find that promoter and gene body methylation have minimal redundancy, and either one is sufficient to signify low expression. Finally, we obtain increased modeling power by integrating histone modification data with the DNA methylation data, showing that neither type of information fully subsumes the other. Conclusion: Our results suggest that DNA methylation outside promoters also plays critical roles in gene regulation. Future studies on gene regulatory mechanisms and disease-associated differential methylation should pay more attention to DNA methylation at gene bodies and other non-promoter regions.

C.			The Genome of the Clonal Raider Ant Cerapachys biroi	CURRENT BIOLOGY												Social insects are important models for social evolution and behavior. However, in many species, experimental control over important factors that regulate division of labor, such as genotype and age, is limited [1, 2]. Furthermore, most species have fixed queen and worker castes, making it difficult to establish causality between the molecular mechanisms that underlie reproductive division of labor, the hallmark of insect societies [3]. Here we present the genome of the queenless clonal raider ant Cerapachys biroi, a powerful new study system that does not suffer from these constraints. Using cytology and RAD-seq, we show that C. biroi reproduces via automixis with central fusion and that heterozygosity is lost extremely slowly. As a consequence, nestmates are almost clonally related (r = 0.996). Workers in C. biroi colonies synchronously alternate between reproduction and brood care, and young workers eclose in synchronized cohorts. We show that genes associated with division of labor in other social insects are conserved in C. biroi and dynamically regulated during the colony cycle. With unparalleled experimental control over an individual's genotype and age, and the ability to induce reproduction and brood care [4, 5], C. biroi has great potential to illuminate the molecular regulation of division of labor.

An integrated epigenomic analysis for type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci in monozygotic twins	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												DNA methylation has a great potential for understanding the aetiology of common complex traits such as Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here we perform genome-wide methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq) in whole-blood-derived DNA from 27 monozygotic twin pairs and follow up results with replication and integrated omics analyses. We identify predominately hypermethylated T2D-related differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and replicate the top signals in 42 unrelated T2D cases and 221 controls. The strongest signal is in the promoter of the MALT1 gene, involved in insulin and glycaemic pathways, and related to taurocholate levels in blood. Integrating the DNA methylome findings with T2D GWAS meta-analysis results reveals a strong enrichment for DMRs in T2D-susceptibility loci. We also detect signals specific to T2D-discordant twins in the GPR61 and PRKCB genes. These replicated T2D associations reflect both likely causal and consequential pathways of the disease. The analysis indicates how an integrated genomics and epigenomics approach, utilizing an MZ twin design, can provide pathogenic insights as well as potential drug targets and biomarkers for T2D and other complex traits.

This transition was accompanied by a shift in the composition of the gut microbiota, but the complementary roles of these bacteria in the symbiosis have remained enigmatic. We obtained high-quality annotated draft genomes of the termite Macrotermes natalensis, its Termitomyces symbiont, and gut metagenomes from workers, soldiers, and a queen. We show that members from 111 of the 128 known glycoside hydrolase families are represented in the symbiosis, that Termitomyces has the genomic capacity to handle complex carbohydrates, and that worker gut microbes primarily contribute enzymes for final digestion of oligosaccharides. This apparent division of labor is consistent with the Macrotermes gut microbes being most important during the second passage of comb material through the termite gut, after a first gut passage where the crude plant substrate is inoculated with Termitomyces asexual spores so that initial fungal growth and polysaccharide decomposition can proceed with high efficiency. Complex conversion of biomass in termite mounds thus appears to be mainly accomplished by complementary cooperation between a domesticated fungal monoculture and a specialized bacterial community. In sharp contrast, the gut microbiota of the queen had highly reduced plant decomposition potential, suggesting that mature reproductives digest fungal material provided by workers rather than plant substrate.				de Vries, Ronald/F-8125-2011; Zhang, Guojie/B-6188-2014; Hauser, Frank/M-2952-2014; de Beer, Z.

This study was to identify mutations in the 60 genes that were known to be associated with RP in 157 unrelated Chinese families with RP. Genomic DNA from probands was initially analyzed by whole exome sequencing. Sanger sequencing was used to confirm potential candidate variants affecting the encoded residues in the 60 genes, including heterozygous variants from genes that are related to autosomal dominant RP, homozygous or compound heterozygous variants from genes that are related to autosomal recessive RP, and hemizygous variants from genes that are related to X-linked RP. Synonymous and intronic variants were also examined to confirm whether they could affect splicing. A total of 244 candidate variants were detected by exome sequencing. Sanger sequencing confirmed 240 variants out of the 244 candidates. Informatics and segregation analyses suggested 110 potential pathogenic mutations in 28 out of the 60 genes involving 79 of the 157 (50 %) families, including 31 (39 %, 31/79) families with heterozygous mutations in autosomal dominant genes, 37 (47 %, 37/79) families with homozygous (9) or compound heterozygous (28) mutations in autosomal recessive genes, and 11 (14 %, 11/79) families with hemizygous mutations in X-linked genes. Of the 110 identified variants, 74 (67 %) were novel. The genetic defects in approximately half of the 157 studies families were detected by exome sequencing. A comprehensive analysis of the 60 known genes not only expanded the mutation spectrum and frequency of the 60 genes in Chinese patients with RP, but also provided an overview of the molecular etiology of RP in Chinese patients. The analysis of the known genes also supplied the foundation and clues for discovering novel causative RP genes.																	0340-6717	1432-1203				OCT	2014	133	10					1255	1271		10.1007/s00439-014-1460-2								WOS:000341828900004	24938718					J	Tosser-Klopp, G; Bardou, P; Bouchez, O; Cabau, C; Crooijmans, R; Dong, Y; Donnadieu-Tonon, C; Eggen, A; Heuven, HCM; Jamli, S; Jiken, AJ; Klopp, C; Lawley, CT; McEwan, J; Martin, P; Moreno, CR; Mulsant, P; Nabihoudine, I; Pailhoux, E; Palhiere, I; Rupp, R; Sarry, J; Sayre, BL; Tircazes, A; Wang, J; Wang, W; Zhang, WG				Tosser-Klopp, Gwenola; Bardou, Philippe; Bouchez, Olivier; Cabau, Cedric; Crooijmans, Richard; Dong, Yang; Donnadieu-Tonon, Cecile; Eggen, Andre; Heuven, Henri C.

Primary goals are QTL detection and genomic selection. The purpose here was design of a 50-60,000 SNP chip for goats. The success of a moderate density SNP assay depends on reliable bioinformatic SNP detection procedures, the technological success rate of the SNP design, even spacing of SNPs on the genome and selection of Minor Allele Frequencies (MAF) suitable to use in diverse breeds. Through the federation of three SNP discovery projects consolidated as the International Goat Genome Consortium, we have identified approximately twelve million high quality SNP variants in the goat genome stored in a database together with their biological and technical characteristics. These SNPs were identified within and between six breeds (meat, milk and mixed): Alpine, Boer, Creole, Katjang, Saanen and Savanna, comprising a total of 97 animals. Whole genome and Reduced Representation Library sequences were aligned on >10 kb scaffolds of the de novo goat genome assembly. The 60,000 selected SNPs, evenly spaced on the goat genome, were submitted for oligo manufacturing (Illumina, Inc) and published in dbSNP along with flanking sequences and map position on goat assemblies (i.e. scaffolds and pseudo-chromosomes), sheep genome V2 and cattle UMD3.1 assembly. Ten breeds were then used to validate the SNP content and 52,295 loci could be successfully genotyped and used to generate a final cluster file. The combined strategy of using mainly whole genome Next Generation Sequencing and mapping on a contig genome assembly, complemented with Illumina design tools proved to be efficient in producing this GoatSNP50 chip. Advances in use of molecular markers are expected to accelerate goat genomic studies in coming years.

It is known to be a heterogeneous disease with several molecular and histological subtypes. Here we perform whole-genome sequencing of 49 GCs with diffuse (N = 31) and intestinal (N = 18) histological subtypes and identify three mutational signatures, impacting TpT, CpG and TpCp[A/T] nucleotides. The diffuse-type GCs show significantly lower clonality and smaller numbers of somatic and structural variants compared with intestinal subtype. We further divide the diffuse subtype into one with infrequent genetic changes/low clonality and another with relatively higher clonality and mutations impacting TpT dinucleotide. Notably, we discover frequent and exclusive mutations in Ephrins and SLIT/ROBO signalling pathway genes. Overall, this study delivers new insights into the mutational heterogeneity underlying distinct histologic subtypes of GC that could have important implications for future research in the diagnosis and treatment of GC.

Genome and transcriptome of the porcine whipworm Trichuris suis	NATURE GENETICS												Trichuris (whipworm) infects 1 billion people worldwide and causes a disease (trichuriasis) that results in major socioeconomic losses in both humans and pigs. Trichuriasis relates to an inflammation of the large intestine manifested in bloody diarrhea, and chronic disease can cause malnourishment and stunting in children. Paradoxically, Trichuris of pigs has shown substantial promise as a treatment for human autoimmune disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and multiple sclerosis. Here we report whole-genome sequencing at similar to 140-fold coverage of adult male and female T. suis and similar to 80-Mb draft assemblies. We explore stage-, sex- and tissue-specific transcription of mRNAs and small noncoding RNAs.

The BMR spends its entire life underground, protecting itself from predators and climatic fluctuations while challenging it with multiple stressors such as darkness, hypoxia, hypercapnia, energetics and high pathonecity. Here we sequence and analyse the BMR genome and transcriptome, highlighting the possible genomic adaptive responses to the underground stressors. Our results show high rates of RNA/DNA editing, reduced chromosome rearrangements, an over-representation of short interspersed elements (SINEs) probably linked to hypoxia tolerance, degeneration of vision and progression of photoperiodic perception, tolerance to hypercapnia and hypoxia and resistance to cancer. The remarkable traits of the BMR, together with its genomic and transcriptomic information, enhance our understanding of adaptation to extreme environments and will enable the utilization of BMR models for biomedical research in the fight against cancer, stroke and cardiovascular diseases.

Extensive studies of miRNAs have been performed in model plants such as rice and Arabidopsis thaliana. In maize, most miRNAs and their target genes were analyzed and identified by clearly different treatments, such as response to low nitrate, salt and drought stress. However, little is known about miRNAs involved in maize ear development. The objective of this study is to identify conserved and novel miRNAs and their target genes by combined small RNA and degradome sequencing at four inflorescence developmental stages. Results: We used deep-sequencing, miRNA microarray assays and computational methods to identify, profile, and describe conserved and non-conserved miRNAs at four ear developmental stages, which resulted in identification of 22 conserved and 21-maize-specific miRNA families together with their corresponding miRNA*. Comparison of miRNA expression in these developmental stages revealed 18 differentially expressed miRNA families. Finally, a total of 141 genes (251 transcripts) targeted by 102 small RNAs including 98 miRNAs and 4 ta-siRNAs were identified by genomic-scale high-throughput sequencing of miRNA cleaved mRNAs. Moreover, the differentially expressed miRNAs-mediated pathways that regulate the development of ears were discussed. Conclusions: This study confirmed 22 conserved miRNA families and discovered 26 novel miRNAs in maize. Moreover, we identified 141 target genes of known and new miRNAs and ta-siRNAs. Of these, 72 genes (117 transcripts) targeted by 62 differentially expressed miRNAs may attribute to the development of maize ears. Identification and characterization of these important classes of regulatory genes in maize may improve our understanding of molecular mechanisms controlling ear development.																	1471-2164					JAN 14	2014	15								25	10.1186/1471-2164-15-25								WOS:000331094600001	24422852					J	Yang, J; Yang, Y; Wu, WM; Zhao, J; Jiang, L				Yang, Jun; Yang, Yu; Wu, Wei-Min; Zhao, Jiao; Jiang, Lei			Evidence of Polyethylene Biodegradation by Bacterial Strains from the Guts of Plastic-Eating Waxworms	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Polyethylene (PE) has been considered nonbiodegradable for decades. Although the biodegradation of PE by bacterial cultures has been occasionally described, valid evidence of PE biodegradation has remained limited in the literature. We found that waxworms, or Indian mealmoths (the larvae of Plodia interpunctella), were capable of chewing and eating PE films. Two bacterial strains capable of degrading PE were isolated from this worms gut, Enterobacter asburiae YT1 and Bacillus sp. YP1. Over a 28-day incubation period of the two strains on PE films, viable biofilms formed, and the PE films hydrophobicity decreased. Obvious damage, including pits and cavities (0.3-0.4 mu m in depth), was observed on the surfaces of the PE films using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The formation of carbonyl groups was verified using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and microattenuated total reflectance/Fourier transform infrared (micro-ATR/FTIR) imaging microscope. Suspension cultures of YT1 and YP1 (10(8) cells/mL) were able to degrade approximately 6.1 +/- 0.3% and 10.7 +/- 0.2% of the PE films (100 mg), respectively, over a 60-day incubation period. The molecular weights of the residual PE films were lower, and the release of 12 water-soluble daughter products was also detected. The results demonstrated the presence of PE-degrading bacteria in the guts of waxworms and provided promising evidence for the biodegradation of PE in the environment.

In particular, the green alga Chlorella protothecoides sp. 0710 is regarded as one of the best candidates for commercial manufacture of microalgae-derived biofuel. This is due not only to its ability to live autotrophically through photosynthesis, but also to its capacity to produce a large amount of biomass and lipid through fermentation of glucose. However, until the present study, neither its genome sequence nor the platform required for molecular manipulations were available. Results: We generated a draft genome for C. protothecoides, and compared its genome size and gene content with that of Chlorella variabilis NC64A and Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169. This comparison revealed that C. protothecoides has a reduced genome size of 22.9 Mbp, about half that of its close relatives. The C. protothecoides genome encodes a smaller number of genes, fewer multi-copy genes, fewer unique genes, and fewer genome rearrangements compared with its close relatives. In addition, three Chlorella-specific hexose-proton symporter (HUP)-like genes were identified that enable the consumption of glucose and, consequently, heterotrophic growth. Furthermore, through comparative transcriptomic and proteomic studies, we generated a global perspective regarding the changes in metabolic pathways under autotrophic and heterotrophic growth conditions. Under heterotrophic conditions, enzymes involved in photosynthesis and CO2 fixation were almost completely degraded, either as mRNAs or as proteins. Meanwhile, the cells were not only capable of quickly assimilating glucose but also showed accelerated glucose catabolism through the upregulation of glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Moreover, the rapid synthesis of pyruvate, upregulation of most enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis, and downregulation of enzymes involved in fatty acid degradation favor the synthesis of fatty acids within the cell. Conclusions: Despite similarities to other Chlorella, C. protothecoides has a smaller genome than its close relatives. Genes involved in glucose utilization were identified, and these genes explained its ability to grow heterotrophically. Transcriptomic and proteomic results provided insight into its extraordinary ability to accumulate large amounts of lipid. The C. protothecoides draft genome will promote the use of this species as a research model.																	1471-2164					JUL 10	2014	15								582	10.1186/1471-2164-15-582								WOS:000339204100001	25012212					J	Raule, N; Sevini, F; Li, ST; Barbieri, A; Tallaro, F; Lomartire, L; Vianello, D; Montesanto, A; Moilanen, JS; Bezrukov, V; Blanche, H; Hervonen, A; Christensen, K; Deiana, L; Gonos, ES; Kirkwood, TBL; Kristensen, P; Leon, A; Pelicci, PG; Poulain, M; Rea, IM; Remacle, J; Robine, JM; Schreiber, S; Sikora, E; Slagboom, PE; Spazzafumo, L; Stazi, MA; Toussaint, O; Vaupel, JW; Rose, G; Majamaa, K; Perola, M; Johnson, TE; Bolund, L; Yang, HM; Passarino, G; Franceschi, C				Raule, Nicola; Sevini, Federica; Li, Shengting; Barbieri, Annalaura; Tallaro, Federica; Lomartire, Laura; Vianello, Dario; Montesanto, Alberto; Moilanen, Jukka S.; Bezrukov, Vladyslav; Blanche, Helene; Hervonen, Antti; Christensen, Kaare; Deiana, Luca; Gonos, Efstathios S.; Kirkwood, Tom B.

The samples were categorized by high-resolution classification, while about 1300 mtDNA molecules (650 ultranonagenarians and an equal number of controls) were completely sequenced. Sequences, unlike standard haplogroup analysis, made possible to evaluate for the first time the cumulative effects of specific, concomitant mtDNA mutations, including those that per se have a low, or very low, impact. In particular, the analysis of the mutations occurring in different OXPHOS complex showed a complex scenario with a different mutation burden in 90+ subjects with respect to controls. These findings suggested that mutations in subunits of the OXPHOS complex I had a beneficial effect on longevity, while the simultaneous presence of mutations in complex I and III (which also occurs in J subhaplogroups involved in LHON) and in complex I and V seemed to be detrimental, likely explaining previous contradictory results. On the whole, our study, which goes beyond haplogroup analysis, suggests that mitochondrial DNA variation does affect human longevity, but its effect is heavily influenced by the interaction between mutations concomitantly occurring on different mtDNA genes.

Methods: Supragingival plaque samples were collected from 10 caries children and 9 caries-free children. Plaque DNA was extracted, used to generate DNA amplicons of the V1-V3 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, and subjected to 454-pyrosequencing. Results: On average, over 22,000 sequences per sample were generated. High bacterial diversity was noted in the plaque of children with caries [170 operational taxonomical units (OTU) at 3% divergence] and caries-free children (201 OTU at 3% divergence) with no significant difference. A total of 8 phyla, 15 classes, 21 orders, 30 families, 41 genera and 99 species were represented. In addition, five predominant phyla (Firmicute, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria) and seven genera (Leptotrichia, Streptococcus, Actinomyces, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Neisseria, and Veillonella) constituted a majority of contents of the total microbiota, independent of the presence or absence of caries. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) presented that caries-related genera included Streptococcus and Veillonella; while Leptotrichia, Selenomonas, Fusobacterium, Capnocytophaga and Porphyromonas were more related to the caries-free samples. Neisseria and Prevotella presented approximately in between. In both groups, the degree of shared organism lineages (as defined by species-level OTUs) among individual supragingival plaque microbiomes was minimal. Conclusion: Our study represented for the first time using pyrosequencing to elucidate and monitor supragingival plaque bacterial diversity at such young age with second primary molar unerrupted. Distinctions were revealed between caries and caries-free microbiomes in terms of microbial community structure. We observed differences in abundance for several microbial groups between the caries and caries-free host populations, which were consistent with the ecological plaque hypothesis. Our approach and findings could be extended to correlating microbiomic changes after occlusion establishment and caries treatment.																	1932-6203					FEB 28	2014	9	2							e89269	10.1371/journal.pone.0089269								WOS:000332396200043	24586647					J	Fang, XD; Seim, I; Huang, ZY; Gerashchenko, MV; Xiong, ZQ; Turanov, AA; Zhu, YB; Lobanov, AV; Fan, DD; Yim, SH; Yao, XM; Ma, SM; Yang, L; Lee, SG; Kim, EB; Bronson, RT; Sumbera, R; Buffenstein, R; Zhou, X; Krogh, A; Park, TJ; Zhang, GJ; Wang, J; Gladyshev, VN				Fang, Xiaodong; Seim, Inge; Huang, Zhiyong; Gerashchenko, Maxim V.; Xiong, Zhiqiang; Turanov, Anton A.; Zhu, Yabing; Lobanov, Alexei V.; Fan, Dingding; Yim, Sun Hee; Yao, Xiaoming; Ma, Siming; Yang, Lan; Lee, Sang-Goo; Kim, Eun Bae; Bronson, Roderick T.; Sumbera, Radim; Buffenstein, Rochelle; Zhou, Xin; Krogh, Anders; Park, Thomas J.; Zhang, Guojie; Wang, Jun; Gladyshev, Vadim N.			Adaptations to a Subterranean Environment and Longevity Revealed by the Analysis of Mole Rat Genomes	CELL REPORTS												Subterranean mammals spend their lives in dark, unventilated environments that are rich in carbon dioxide and ammonia and low in oxygen. Many of these animals are also long-lived and exhibit reduced aging- associated diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. We sequenced the genome of the Damaralandmole rat (DMR, Fukomys damarensis) and improved the genome assembly of the naked mole rat (NMR, Heterocephalus glaber). Comparative genome analyses, along with the transcriptomes of related subterranean rodents, revealed candidate molecular adaptations for subterranean life and longevity, including a divergent insulin peptide, expression of oxygen-carrying globins in the brain, prevention of high CO2-induced pain perception, and enhanced ammonia detoxification. Juxtaposition of the genomes of DMR and other more conventional animals with the genome of NMR revealed several truly exceptional NMR features: unusual thermogenesis, an aberrant melatonin system, pain insensitivity, and unique processing of 28S rRNA. Together, these genomes and transcriptomes extend our understanding of subterranean adaptations, stress resistance, and longevity.

Here we performed single-cell sequencing analysis of a case of colon cancer. Population genetics analyses identified two independent clones in tumor cell population. The major tumor clone harbored APC and TP53 mutations as early oncogenic events, whereas the minor clone contained preponderant CDC27 and PABPC1 mutations. The absence of APC and TP53 mutations in the minor clone supports that these two clones were derived from two cellular origins. Examination of somatic mutation allele frequency spectra of additional 21 whole-tissue exome-sequenced cases revealed the heterogeneity of clonal origins in colon cancer. Next, we identified a mutated gene SLC12A5 that showed a high frequency of mutation at the single-cell level but exhibited low prevalence at the population level. Functional characterization of mutant SLC12A5 revealed its potential oncogenic effect in colon cancer. Our study provides the first exome-wide evidence at single-cell level supporting that colon cancer could be of a biclonal origin, and suggests that low-prevalence mutations in a cohort may also play important protumorigenic roles at the individual level.

Whole genome sequencing of Ethiopian highlanders reveals conserved hypoxia tolerance genes	GENOME BIOLOGY												Background: Although it has long been proposed that genetic factors contribute to adaptation to high altitude, such factors remain largely unverified. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing have made it feasible to analyze genome-wide patterns of genetic variation in human populations. Since traditionally such studies surveyed only a small fraction of the genome, interpretation of the results was limited. Results: We report here the results of the first whole genome resequencing-based analysis identifying genes that likely modulate high altitude adaptation in native Ethiopians residing at 3,500 m above sea level on Bale Plateau or Chennek field in Ethiopia. Using cross-population tests of selection, we identify regions with a significant loss of diversity, indicative of a selective sweep. We focus on a 208 kbp gene-rich region on chromosome 19, which is significant in both of the Ethiopian subpopulations sampled. This region contains eight protein-coding genes and spans 135 SNPs. To elucidate its potential role in hypoxia tolerance, we experimentally tested whether individual genes from the region affect hypoxia tolerance in Drosophila. Three genes significantly impact survival rates in low oxygen: cic, an ortholog of human CIC, Hsl, an ortholog of human LIPE, and Paf-AHa, an ortholog of human PAFAH1B3. Conclusions: Our study reveals evolutionarily conserved genes that modulate hypoxia tolerance. In addition, we show that many of our results would likely be unattainable using data from exome sequencing or microarray studies. This highlights the importance of whole genome sequencing for investigating adaptation by natural selection.

To understand the molecular underpinning of pathogenicity in Foc, the genomes and transcriptomes of two Foc isolates were sequenced. Methodology/Principal Findings: Genome analysis revealed that the genome structures of race 1 and race 4 isolates were highly syntenic with those of F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici strain Fol4287. A large number of putative virulence associated genes were identified in both Foc genomes, including genes putatively involved in root attachment, cell degradation, detoxification of toxin, transport, secondary metabolites biosynthesis and signal transductions. Importantly, relative to the Foc race 1 isolate (Foc1), the Foc race 4 isolate (Foc4) has evolved with some expanded gene families of transporters and transcription factors for transport of toxins and nutrients that may facilitate its ability to adapt to host environments and contribute to pathogenicity to banana. Transcriptome analysis disclosed a significant difference in transcriptional responses between Foc1 and Foc4 at 48 h post inoculation to the banana 'Brazil' in comparison with the vegetative growth stage. Of particular note, more virulence-associated genes were up regulated in Foc4 than in Foc1. Several signaling pathways like the mitogen-activated protein kinase Fmk1 mediated invasion growth pathway, the FGA1-mediated G protein signaling pathway and a pathogenicity associated two-component system were activated in Foc4 rather than in Foc1. Together, these differences in gene content and transcription response between Foc1 and Foc4 might account for variation in their virulence during infection of the banana variety 'Brazil'. Conclusions/Significance: Foc genome sequences will facilitate us to identify pathogenicity mechanism involved in the banana vascular wilt disease development. These will thus advance us develop effective methods for managing the banana vascular wilt disease, including improvement of disease resistance in banana.																	1932-6203					APR 17	2014	9	4							e95543	10.1371/journal.pone.0095543								WOS:000335309100136	24743270					J	Huang, X; Zheng, J; Chen, M; Zhao, YY; Zhang, CL; Liu, LF; Xie, WW; Shi, SQ; Wei, Y; Lei, DZ; Xu, CM; Wu, QC; Guo, XL; Shi, XM; Zhou, Y; Liu, QF; Gao, Y; Jiang, FM; Zhang, HY; Su, FX; Ge, HJ; Li, XC; Pan, XY; Chen, SP; Chen, F; Fang, Q; Jiang, H; Lau, TK; Wang, W				Huang, Xuan; Zheng, Jing; Chen, Min; Zhao, Yangyu; Zhang, Chunlei; Liu, Lifu; Xie, Weiwei; Shi, Shuqiong; Wei, Yuan; Lei, Dongzhu; Xu, Chenming; Wu, Qichang; Guo, Xiaoling; Shi, Xiaomei; Zhou, Yi; Liu, Qiufang; Gao, Ya; Jiang, Fuman; Zhang, Hongyun; Su, Fengxia; Ge, Huijuan; Li, Xuchao; Pan, Xiaoyu; Chen, Shengpei; Chen, Fang; Fang, Qun; Jiang, Hui; Lau, Tze Kin; Wang, Wei			Noninvasive prenatal testing of trisomies 21 and 18 by massively parallel sequencing of maternal plasma DNA in twin pregnancies	PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS												Objective The objective of this study is to assess the performance of noninvasive prenatal testing for trisomies 21 and 18 on the basis of massively parallel sequencing of cell-free DNA from maternal plasma in twin pregnancies. Method A double-blind study was performed over 12 months. A total of 189 pregnant women carrying twins were recruited from seven hospitals. Maternal plasma DNA sequencing was performed to detect trisomies 21 and 18. The fetal karyotype was used as gold standard to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of sequencing-based noninvasive prenatal test. Results There were nine cases of trisomy 21 and two cases of trisomy 18 confirmed by karyotyping. Plasma DNA sequencing correctly identified nine cases of trisomy 21 and one case of trisomy 18. The discordant case of trisomy 18 was an unusual case of monozygotic twin with discordant fetal karyotype (one normal and the other trisomy 18). The sensitivity and specificity of maternal plasma DNA sequencing for fetal trisomy 21 were both 100% and for fetal trisomy 18 were 50% and 100%, respectively. Conclusion Our study further supported that sequencing-based noninvasive prenatal testing of trisomy 21 in twin pregnancies could be achieved with a high accuracy, which could effectively avoid almost 95% of invasive prenatal diagnosis procedures.

Recent genomic studies have identified TP53, AXIN1, and CTNNB1 as the most frequently mutated genes. Lower frequency mutations have been reported in ARID1A, ARID2 and JAK1. In addition, hepatitis B virus (HBV) integrations into the human genome have been associated with HCC. Results: Here, we deep-sequence 42 HCC patients with a combination of whole genome, exome and transcriptome sequencing to identify the mutational landscape of HCC using a reasonably large discovery cohort. We find frequent mutations in TP53, CTNNB1 and AXIN1, and rare but likely functional mutations in BAP1 and IDH1. Besides frequent hepatitis B virus integrations at TERT, we identify translocations at the boundaries of TERT. A novel deletion is identified in CTNNB1 in a region that is heavily mutated in multiple cancers. We also find multiple high-allelic frequency mutations in the extracellular matrix protein LAMA2. Lower expression levels of LAMA2 correlate with a proliferative signature, and predict poor survival and higher chance of cancer recurrence in HCC patients, suggesting an important role of the extracellular matrix and cell adhesion in tumor progression of a subgroup of HCC patients. Conclusions: The heterogeneous disease of HCC features diverse modes of genomic alteration. In addition to common point mutations, structural variations and methylation changes, there are several virus-associated changes, including gene disruption or activation, formation of chimeric viral-human transcripts, and DNA copy number changes.

Peach, Prunus persica, is a typical perennial fruit crop that has ornamental and edible varieties. Unlike other fruit crops, cultivated peach includes a large number of phenotypes but few polymorphisms. In this study, we explore the genetic basis of domestication in peach and the influence of humans on its evolution. Results: We perform large-scale resequencing of 10 wild and 74 cultivated peach varieties, including 9 ornamental, 23 breeding, and 42 landrace lines. We identify 4.6 million SNPs, a large number of which could explain the phenotypic variation in cultivated peach. Population analysis shows a single domestication event, the speciation of P. persica from wild peach. Ornamental and edible peach both belong to P. persica, along with another geographically separated subgroup, Prunus ferganensis. We identify 147 and 262 genes under edible and ornamental selection, respectively. Some of these genes are associated with important biological features. We perform a population heterozygosity analysis in different plants that indicates that free recombination effects could affect domestication history. By applying artificial selection during the domestication of the peach and facilitating its asexual propagation, humans have caused a sharp decline of the heterozygote ratio of SNPs. Conclusions: Our analyses enhance our knowledge of the domestication history of perennial fruit crops, and the dataset we generated could be useful for future research on comparative population genomics.

Losses tend to increase with the passage of years. Sporisorium scitamineum is the fungus that causes sugarcane smut. This fungus has the potential to infect all sugarcane species unless a species is resistant to biotrophic fungal pathogens. However, it remains unclear how the fungus breaks through the cell walls of sugarcane and causes the formation of black or gray whip-like structures on the sugarcane plants. Results: Here, we report the first high-quality genome sequence of S. scitamineum assembled de novo with a contig N-50 of 41 kb, a scaffold N-50 of 884 kb and genome size 19.8 Mb, containing an estimated 6,636 genes. This phytopathogen can utilize a wide range of carbon and nitrogen sources. A reduced set of genes encoding plant cell wall hydrolytic enzymes leads to its biotrophic lifestyle, in which damage to the host should be minimized. As a bipolar mating fungus, a and b loci are linked and the mating-type locus segregates as a single locus. The S. scitamineum genome has only 6 G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) grouped into five classes, which are responsible for transducing extracellular signals into intracellular responses, however, the genome is without any PTH11-like GPCR. There are 192 virulence associated genes in the genome of S. scitamineum, among which 31 expressed in all the stages, which mainly encode for energy metabolism and redox of short-chain compound related enzymes. Sixty-eight candidates for secreted effector proteins (CSEPs) were found in the genome of S. scitamineum, and 32 of them expressed in the different stages of sugarcane infection, which are probably involved in infection and/or triggering defense responses. There are two non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene clusters that are involved in the generation of ferrichrome and ferrichrome A, while the terpenes gene cluster is composed of three unknown function genes and seven biosynthesis related genes. Conclusions: As a destructive pathogen to sugar industry, the S. scitamineum genome will facilitate future research on the genomic basis and the pathogenic mechanisms of sugarcane smut.																	1471-2164					NOV 19	2014	15								996	10.1186/1471-2164-15-996								WOS:000345252600001	25406499					J	Liu, MJ; Zhao, J; Cai, QL; Liu, GC; Wang, JR; Zhao, ZH; Liu, P; Dai, L; Yan, GJ; Wang, WJ; Li, XS; Chen, Y; Sun, YD; Liu, ZG; Lin, MJ; Xiao, J; Chen, YY; Li, XF; Wu, B; Ma, Y; Jian, JB; Yang, W; Yuan, Z; Sun, XC; Wei, YL; Yu, LL; Zhang, C; Liao, SG; He, RJ; Guang, XM; Wang, Z; Zhang, YY; Luo, LH				Liu, Meng-Jun; Zhao, Jin; Cai, Qing-Le; Liu, Guo-Cheng; Wang, Jiu-Rui; Zhao, Zhi-Hui; Liu, Ping; Dai, Li; Yan, Guijun; Wang, Wen-Jiang; Li, Xian-Song; Chen, Yan; Sun, Yu-Dong; Liu, Zhi-Guo; Lin, Min-Juan; Xiao, Jing; Chen, Ying-Ying; Li, Xiao-Feng; Wu, Bin; Ma, Yong; Jian, Jian-Bo; Yang, Wei; Yuan, Zan; Sun, Xue-Chao; Wei, Yan-Li; Yu, Li-Li; Zhang, Chi; Liao, Sheng-Guang; He, Rong-Jun; Guang, Xuan-Min; Wang, Zhuo; Zhang, Yue-Yang; Luo, Long-Hai			The complex jujube genome provides insights into fruit tree biology	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												The jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.), a member of family Rhamnaceae, is a major dry fruit and a traditional herbal medicine for more than one billion people. Here we present a high-quality sequence for the complex jujube genome, the first genome sequence of Rhamnaceae, using an integrated strategy. The final assembly spans 437.65Mb (98.6% of the estimated) with 321.45Mb anchored to the 12 pseudo-chromosomes and contains 32,808 genes. The jujube genome has undergone frequent inter-chromosome fusions and segmental duplications, but no recent whole-genome duplication. Further analyses of the jujube-specific genes and transcriptome data from 15 tissues reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying some specific properties of the jujube. Its high vitamin C content can be attributed to a unique high level expression of genes involved in both biosynthesis and regeneration. Our study provides insights into jujube-specific biology and valuable genomic resources for the improvement of Rhamnaceae plants and other fruit trees.																	2041-1723					OCT	2014	5								5315	10.1038/ncomms6315								WOS:000344061800001	25350882					J	Chen, JY; Peng, ZY; Zhang, RL; Yang, XZ; Tan, BCM; Fang, HY; Liu, CJ; Shi, MM; Ye, ZQ; Zhang, YE; Deng, MH; Zhang, XQ; Li, CY				Chen, Jia-Yu; Peng, Zhiyu; Zhang, Rongli; Yang, Xin-Zhuang; Tan, Bertrand Chin-Ming; Fang, Huaying; Liu, Chu-Jun; Shi, Mingming; Ye, Zhi-Qiang; Zhang, Yong E.; Deng, Minghua; Zhang, Xiuqin; Li, Chuan-Yun			RNA Editome in Rhesus Macaque Shaped by Purifying Selection	PLOS GENETICS												Understanding of the RNA editing process has been broadened considerably by the next generation sequencing technology; however, several issues regarding this regulatory step remain unresolved - the strategies to accurately delineate the editome, the mechanism by which its profile is maintained, and its evolutionary and functional relevance. Here we report an accurate and quantitative profile of the RNA editome for rhesus macaque, a close relative of human. By combining genome and transcriptome sequencing of multiple tissues from the same animal, we identified 31,250 editing sites, of which 99.8% are A-to-G transitions. We verified 96.6% of editing sites in coding regions and 97.5% of randomly selected sites in non-coding regions, as well as the corresponding levels of editing by multiple independent means, demonstrating the feasibility of our experimental paradigm. Several lines of evidence supported the notion that the adenosine deamination is associated with the macaque editome - A-to-G editing sites were flanked by sequences with the attributes of ADAR substrates, and both the sequence context and the expression profile of ADARs are relevant factors in determining the quantitative variance of RNA editing across different sites and tissue types. In support of the functional relevance of some of these editing sites, substitution valley of decreased divergence was detected around the editing site, suggesting the evolutionary constraint in maintaining some of these editing substrates with their double-stranded structure. These findings thus complement the "continuous probing" model that postulates tinkering-based origination of a small proportion of functional editing sites. In conclusion, the macaque editome reported here highlights RNA editing as a widespread functional regulation in primate evolution, and provides an informative framework for further understanding RNA editing in human.

We investigated EBV-associated genomic and epigenomic variations in gastric cancer cells and tumors. METHODS: We performed whole-genome, transcriptome, and epigenome sequence analyses of a gastric adenocarcinoma cell line (AGS cells), before and after EBV infection. We then looked for alterations in gastric tumor samples, with (n = 34) or without (n = 100) EBV infection, collected from patients at the Prince of Wales Hospital, Chinese University of Hong Kong (from 1998 through 2004), or the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China (from 1999 through 2006). RESULTS: Transcriptome analysis showed that infected cells expressed 9 EBV genes previously detected in EBV-associated gastric tumors and 71 EBV genes not previously reported in gastric tumors. Ten viral genes that had not been reported previously in gastric cancer but were expressed most highly in EBV-infected cells also were expressed in primary EBV-positive gastric tumors. Whole-genome sequence analysis identified 45 EBV-associated nonsynonymous mutations. These mutations, in genes such as AKT2, CCNA1, MAP3K4, and TGFBR1, were associated significantly with EBV-positive gastric tumors, compared with EBV-negative tumors. An activating mutation in AKT2 was associated with reduced survival times of patients with EBV-positive gastric cancer (P = .006); this mutation was found to dysregulate mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. Integrated epigenome and transcriptome analyses identified 216 genes transcriptionally down-regulated by EBV-associated hypermethylation; methylation of ACSS1, FAM3B, IHH, and TRABD increased significantly in EBV-positive tumors. Overexpression of Indian hedgehog (IHH) and TraB domain containing (TRABD) increased proliferation and colony formation of gastric cancer cells, whereas knockdown of these genes reduced these activities. We found 5 signaling pathways (axon guidance, focal adhesion formation, interactions among cytokines and receptors, mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, and actin cytoskeleton regulation) to be affected commonly by EBV-associated genomic and epigenomic alterations. CONCLUSIONS: By using genomic, transcriptome, and epigenomic comparisons of EBV infected vs noninfected gastric cancer cells and tumor samples, we identified alterations in genes, gene expression, and methylation that affect different signaling networks. These might be involved in EBV-associated gastric carcinogenesis.				Chan, TingFung/A-6161-2013; Liang, Jessie Qiaoyi/K-7559-2014; Kang, Wei/C-5451-2016; Tang, Senwei/F-2278-2015; Chan, Francis K.

Our objective is to characterize alterations observed by exome sequencing and sequencing of the TERT promoter, and to examine the functional relevance of histone lysine (K)-specific demethylase 6A (KDM6A/UTX), a frequently mutated histone demethylase, in bladder cancer. Experimental Design: We analyzed bladder cancer samples from 54 U.S. patients by exome and targeted sequencing and confirmed somatic variants using normal tissue from the same patient. We examined the biologic function of KDM6A using in vivo and in vitro assays. Results: We observed frequent somatic alterations in BRCA1 associated protein-1 (BAP1) in 15% of tumors, including deleterious alterations to the deubiquitinase active site and the nuclear localization signal. BAP1 mutations contribute to a high frequency of tumors with breast cancer (BRCA) DNA repair pathway alterations and were significantly associated with papillary histologic features in tumors. BAP1 and KDM6A mutations significantly co-occurred in tumors. Somatic variants altering the TERT promoter were found in 69% of tumors but were not correlated with alterations in other bladder cancer genes. We examined the function of KDM6A, altered in 24% of tumors, and show depletion in human bladder cancer cells, enhanced in vitro proliferation, in vivo tumor growth, and cell migration. Conclusions: This study is the first to identify frequent BAP1 and BRCA pathway alterations in bladder cancer, show TERT promoter alterations are independent of other bladder cancer gene alterations, and show KDM6A loss is a driver of the bladder cancer phenotype.

The results provide a global view of gene expression profiles. The 9064 identified high confident proteins covered 50.2% of all gene products in the translatome. Those proteins with function of adhesion, development, reproduction, and so on are low abundant in transcriptome and translatome but absent in proteome. Taking the translatome as the background of protein expression, we found that the protein abundance plays a decisive role and hydrophobicity has a greater influence than molecular weight and isoelectric point on protein detectability. Thus, the enrichment strategy used for low-abundant transcription factors helped to identify missing proteins. In addition, those peptides with single amino acid polymorphisms played a significant role for the disease research, although they might negligibly contribute to new protein identification. The proteome raw and metadata of proteome were collected using the iProX submission system and submitted to ProteomeXchange (PXD000529, PXD000533, and PXD000535). All detailed information in this study can be accessed from the Chinese Chromosome-Centric Human Proteome Database.

Although the Bactrian camel and dromedary are large, typically arid-desert-adapted mammals, alpacas are adapted to plateaus. Here we present high-quality genome sequences of these three species. Our analysis reveals the demographic history of these species since the Tortonian Stage of the Miocene and uncovers a striking correlation between large fluctuations in population size and geological time boundaries. Comparative genomic analysis reveals complex features related to desert adaptations, including fat and water metabolism, stress responses to heat, aridity, intense ultraviolet radiation and choking dust. Transcriptomic analysis of Bactrian camels further reveals unique osmoregulation, osmoprotection and compensatory mechanisms for water reservation underpinned by high blood glucose levels. We hypothesize that these physiological mechanisms represent kidney evolutionary adaptations to the desert environment. This study advances our understanding of camelid evolution and the adaptation of camels to arid-desert environments.

High-coverage sequencing and annotated assemblies of the budgerigar genome	GIGASCIENCE												Background: Parrots belong to a group of behaviorally advanced vertebrates and have an advanced ability of vocal learning relative to other vocal-learning birds. They can imitate human speech, synchronize their body movements to a rhythmic beat, and understand complex concepts of referential meaning to sounds. However, little is known about the genetics of these traits. Elucidating the genetic bases would require whole genome sequencing and a robust assembly of a parrot genome. Findings: We present a genomic resource for the budgerigar, an Australian Parakeet (Melopsittacus undulatus) - the most widely studied parrot species in neuroscience and behavior. We present genomic sequence data that includes over 300x raw read coverage from multiple sequencing technologies and chromosome optical maps from a single male animal. The reads and optical maps were used to create three hybrid assemblies representing some of the largest genomic scaffolds to date for a bird; two of which were annotated based on similarities to reference sets of non-redundant human, zebra finch and chicken proteins, and budgerigar transcriptome sequence assemblies. The sequence reads for this project were in part generated and used for both the Assemblathon 2 competition and the first de novo assembly of a giga-scale vertebrate genome utilizing PacBio single-molecule sequencing. Conclusions: Across several quality metrics, these budgerigar assemblies are comparable to or better than the chicken and zebra finch genome assemblies built from traditional Sanger sequencing reads, and are sufficient to analyze regions that are difficult to sequence and assemble, including those not yet assembled in prior bird genomes, and promoter regions of genes differentially regulated in vocal learning brain regions. This work provides valuable data and material for genome technology development and for investigating the genomics of complex behavioral traits.

However, few data are available regarding the clinical outcome, which provides vital reference for further application of the methodology. Here, we present a clinical evaluation of NGS-based preimplantation genetic diagnosis/screening (PGD/PGS) compared with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array-based PGD/PGS as a control. Results: A total of 395 couples participated. They were carriers of either translocation or inversion mutations, or were patients with recurrent miscarriage and/or advanced maternal age. A total of 1,512 blastocysts were biopsied on D5 after fertilization, with 1,058 blastocysts set aside for SNP array testing and 454 blastocysts for NGS testing. In the NGS cycles group, the implantation, clinical pregnancy and miscarriage rates were 52.6% (60/114), 61.3% (49/80) and 14.3% (7/49), respectively. In the SNP array cycles group, the implantation, clinical pregnancy and miscarriage rates were 47.6% (139/292), 56.7% (115/203) and 14.8% (17/115), respectively. The outcome measures of both the NGS and SNP array cycles were the same with insignificant differences. There were 150 blastocysts that underwent both NGS and SNP array analysis, of which seven blastocysts were found with inconsistent signals. All other signals obtained from NGS analysis were confirmed to be accurate by validation with qPCR. The relative copy number of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) for each blastocyst that underwent NGS testing was evaluated, and a significant difference was found between the copy number of mtDNA for the euploid and the chromosomally abnormal blastocysts. So far, out of 42 ongoing pregnancies, 24 babies were born in NGS cycles; all of these babies are healthy and free of any developmental problems. Conclusions: This study provides the first evaluation of the clinical outcomes of NGS-based pre-implantation genetic diagnosis/screening, and shows the reliability of this method in a clinical and array-based laboratory setting. NGS provides an accurate approach to detect embryonic imbalanced segmental rearrangements, to avoid the potential risks of false signals from SNP array in this study.																		2047-217X				DEC 4	2014	3								30	10.1186/2047-217X-3-30								WOS:000365658900001	25685330					J	Christin, PA; Arakaki, M; Osborne, CP; Brautigam, A; Sage, RF; Hibberd, JM; Kelly, S; Covshoff, S; Wong, GKS; Hancock, L; Edwards, EJ				Christin, Pascal-Antoine; Arakaki, Monica; Osborne, Colin P.; Braeutigam, Andrea; Sage, Rowan F.; Hibberd, Julian M.; Kelly, Steven; Covshoff, Sarah; Wong, Gane Ka-Shu; Hancock, Lillian; Edwards, Erika J.			Shared origins of a key enzyme during the evolution of C-4 and CAM metabolism	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY												CAM and C-4 photosynthesis are two key plant adaptations that have evolved independently multiple times, and are especially prevalent in particular groups of plants, including the Caryophyllales. We investigate the origin of photosynthetic PEPC, a key enzyme of both the CAM and C-4 pathways. We combine phylogenetic analyses of genes encoding PEPC with analyses of RNA sequence data of Portulaca, the only plants known to perform both CAM and C-4 photosynthesis. Three distinct gene lineages encoding PEPC exist in eudicots (namely ppc-1E1, ppc-1E2 and ppc-2), one of which (ppc-1E1) was recurrently recruited for use in both CAM and C-4 photosynthesis within the Caryophyllales. This gene is present in multiple copies in the cacti and relatives, including Portulaca. The PEPC involved in the CAM and C-4 cycles of Portulaca are encoded by closely related yet distinct genes. The CAM-specific gene is similar to genes from related CAM taxa, suggesting that CAM has evolved before C-4 in these species. The similar origin of PEPC and other genes involved in the CAM and C-4 cycles highlights the shared early steps of evolutionary trajectories towards CAM and C-4, which probably diverged irreversibly only during the optimization of CAM and C-4 phenotypes.

Epigenetics is increasingly believed to play a major role in the development of common clinical phenotypes, including major depressive disorder. Results: Genome-wide MeDIP-Sequencing was carried out on a total of 50 monozygotic twin pairs from the UK and Australia that are discordant for depression. We show that major depressive disorder is associated with significant hypermethylation within the coding region of ZBTB20, and is replicated in an independent cohort of 356 unrelated case-control individuals. The twins with major depressive disorder also show increased global variation in methylation in comparison with their unaffected co-twins. ZBTB20 plays an essential role in the specification of the Cornu Ammonis-1 field identity in the developing hippocampus, a region previously implicated in the development of major depressive disorder. Conclusions: Our results suggest that aberrant methylation profiles affecting the hippocampus are associated with major depressive disorder and show the potential of the epigenetic twin model in neuro-psychiatric disease.

Jill			Paralogous Radiations of PIN Proteins with Multiple Origins of Noncanonical PIN Structure	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												The plant hormone auxin is a conserved regulator of development which has been implicated in the generation of morphological novelty. PIN-FORMED1 (PIN) auxin efflux carriers are central to auxin function by regulating its distribution. PIN family members have divergent structures and cellular localizations, but the origin and evolutionary significance of this variation is unresolved. To characterize PIN family evolution, we have undertaken phylogenetic and structural analyses with a massive increase in taxon sampling over previous studies. Our phylogeny shows that following the divergence of the bryophyte and lycophyte lineages, two deep duplication events gave rise to three distinct lineages of PIN proteins in euphyllophytes. Subsequent independent radiations within each of these lineages were taxonomically asymmetric, giving rise to at least 21 clades of PIN proteins, of which 15 are revealed here for the first time. Although most PIN protein clades share a conserved canonical structure with a modular central loop domain, a small number of noncanonical clades dispersed across the phylogeny have highly divergent protein structure. We propose that PIN proteins underwent sub- and neofunctionalization with substantial modification to protein structure throughout plant evolution. Our results have important implications for plant evolution as they suggest that structurally divergent PIN proteins that arose in paralogous radiations contributed to the convergent evolution of organ systems in different land plant lineages.

By 2030, the production of rice must increase by at least 25% in order to keep up with global population growth and demand. Accelerated genetic gains in rice improvement are needed to mitigate the effects of climate change and loss of arable land, as well as to ensure a stable global food supply. Findings: We resequenced a core collection of 3,000 rice accessions from 89 countries. All 3,000 genomes had an average sequencing depth of 14x, with average genome coverages and mapping rates of 94.0% and 92.5%, respectively. From our sequencing efforts, approximately 18.9 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in rice were discovered when aligned to the reference genome of the temperate japonica variety, Nipponbare. Phylogenetic analyses based on SNP data confirmed differentiation of the O. sativa gene pool into 5 varietal groups -indica, aus/boro, basmati/sadri, tropical japonica and temperate japonica. Conclusions: Here, we report an international resequencing effort of 3,000 rice genomes. This data serves as a foundation for large-scale discovery of novel alleles for important rice phenotypes using various bioinformatics and/or genetic approaches. It also serves to understand the genomic diversity within O. sativa at a higher level of detail. With the release of the sequencing data, the project calls for the global rice community to take advantage of this data as a foundation for establishing a global, public rice genetic/genomic database and information platform for advancing rice breeding technology for future rice improvement.

With the availability of maize B73 reference genome and whole-genome resequencing of 15 maize inbreds, common variants (CV) and clustering analyses were applied to identify non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) and corresponding candidate genes for drought tolerance. Results: A total of 524 nsSNPs that were associated with 271 candidate genes involved in plant hormone regulation, carbohydrate and sugar metabolism, signaling molecules regulation, redox reaction and acclimation of photosynthesis to environment were detected by CV and cluster analyses. Most of the nsSNPs identified were clustered in bin 1.07 region that harbored six previously reported QTL with relatively high phenotypic variation explained for drought tolerance. Genes Ontology (GO) analysis of candidate genes revealed that there were 35 GO terms related to biotic stimulus and membrane-bounded organelle, showing significant differences between the candidate genes and the reference B73 background. Changes of expression level in these candidate genes for drought tolerance were detected using RNA sequencing for fertilized ovary, basal leaf meristem tissue and roots collected under drought stressed and well-watered conditions. The results indicated that 70% of candidate genes showed significantly expression changes under two water treatments and our strategies for mining candidate genes are feasible and relatively efficient. Conclusions: Our results successfully revealed candidate nsSNPs and associated genes for drought tolerance by comparative sequence analysis of 16 maize inbred lines. Both methods we applied were proved to be efficient for identifying candidate genes for complex traits through the next-generation sequencing technologies (NGS). These selected genes will not only facilitate understanding of genetic basis of drought stress response, but also accelerate genetic improvement through marker-assisted selection in maize.																	1471-2229					APR 1	2014	14								83	10.1186/1471-2229-14-83								WOS:000335345900001	24684805					J	Luan, HM; Meng, N; Liu, P; Feng, Q; Lin, SH; Fu, J; Davidson, R; Chen, XM; Rao, WQ; Chen, F; Jiang, H; Xu, X; Cai, ZW; Wang, J				Luan, Hemi; Meng, Nan; Liu, Ping; Feng, Qiang; Lin, Shuhai; Fu, Jin; Davidson, Robert; Chen, Xiaomin; Rao, Weiqiao; Chen, Fang; Jiang, Hui; Xu, Xun; Cai, Zongwei; Wang, Jun			Pregnancy-Induced Metabolic Phenotype Variations in Maternal Plasma	JOURNAL OF PROTEOME RESEARCH												Metabolic variations occur during normal pregnancy to provide the growing fetus with a supply of nutrients required for its development and to ensure the health of the woman during gestation. Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics was employed to study the metabolic phenotype variations in the maternal plasma that are induced by pregnancy in each of its three trimesters. Nontargeted metabolomics analysis showed that pregnancy significantly altered the profile of metabolites in maternal plasma. The levels of six metabolites were found to change significantly throughout pregnancy, with related metabolic pathway variations observed in biopterin metabolism, phospholipid metabolism, amino acid derivatives, and fatty acid oxidation. In particular, there was a pronounced elevation of dihydrobiopterin (BH2), a compound produced in the synthesis of dopa, dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, in the second trimester, whereas it was markedly decreased in the third trimester. The turnover of BH2 and tryptophan catabolites indicated that the fluctuations of neurotransmitters throughout pregnancy might reveal the metabolic adaption in the maternal body for the growth of the fetus. Furthermore, 11 lipid classes and 41 carnitine species were also determined and this showed variations in the presence of long-chain acylcarnitines and lysophospholipids in later pregnancy, suggesting changes of acylcarnitines and lysophospholipids to meet the energy demands in pregnant women. To our knowledge, this work is the first report of dynamic metabolic signatures and proposed related metabolic pathways in the maternal plasma for normal pregnancies and provided the basis for time-dependent metabolic trajectory against which disease-related disorders may be contrasted.

Nelumbo nucifera is one member of relict plants surviving from the late Cretaceous. Recently, a new sequencing platform PacBio RS II, known as 'SMRT (Single Molecule, Real-Time) sequencing', has been developed. Using the SMRT sequencing to investigate the chloroplast genome of N. nucifera will help to elucidate the plastid evolution of basal eudicots. Results: The sizes of the de novo assembled complete chloroplast genome of N. nucifera were 163,307 bp, 163,747 bp and 163,600 bp with average depths of coverage of 7x, 712x and 105x sequenced by Sanger, Illumina MiSeq and PacBio RS II, respectively. The precise chloroplast genome of N. nucifera was obtained from PacBio RS II data proofread by Illumina MiSeq reads, with a quadripartite structure containing a large single copy region (91,846 bp) and a small single copy region (19,626 bp) separated by two inverted repeat regions (26,064 bp). The genome contains 113 different genes, including four distinct rRNAs, 30 distinct tRNAs and 79 distinct peptide-coding genes. A phylogenetic analysis of 133 taxa from 56 orders indicated that Nelumbo with an age of 177 million years is a sister clade to Platanus, which belongs to the basal eudicots. Basal eudicots began to emerge during the early Jurassic with estimated divergence times at 197 million years using MCMCTree. IR expansions/contractions within the basal eudicots seem to have occurred independently. Conclusions: Because of long reads and lack of bias in coverage of AT-rich regions, PacBio RS II showed a great promise for highly accurate 'finished' genomes, especially for a de novo assembly of genomes. N. nucifera is one member of basal eudicots, however, evolutionary analyses of IR structural variations of N. nucifera and other basal eudicots suggested that IR expansions/contractions occurred independently in these basal eudicots or were caused by independent insertions and deletions. The precise chloroplast genome of N. nucifera will present new information for structural variation of chloroplast genomes and provide new insight into the evolution of basal eudicots at the primary sequence and structural level.																	1471-2229					NOV 19	2014	14								289	10.1186/s12870-014-0289-0								WOS:000346927200001	25407166					J	Zheng, XQ; Zhao, Q; Wu, HJ; Li, W; Wang, HY; Meyer, CA; Qin, QA; Xu, H; Zang, CZ; Jiang, P; Li, FQ; Hou, YQ; He, JX; Wang, J; Wang, J; Zhang, P; Zhang, Y; Liu, XS				Zheng, Xiaoqi; Zhao, Qian; Wu, Hua-Jun; Li, Wei; Wang, Haiyun; Meyer, Clifford A.; Qin, Qian Alvin; Xu, Han; Zang, Chongzhi; Jiang, Peng; Li, Fuqiang; Hou, Yong; He, Jianxing; Wang, Jun; Wang, Jun; Zhang, Peng; Zhang, Yong; Liu, Xiaole Shirley			MethylPurify: tumor purity deconvolution and differential methylation detection from single tumor DNA methylomes	GENOME BIOLOGY												We propose a statistical algorithm MethylPurify that uses regions with bisulfite reads showing discordant methylation levels to infer tumor purity from tumor samples alone. MethylPurify can identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) from individual tumor methylome samples, without genomic variation information or prior knowledge from other datasets. In simulations with mixed bisulfite reads from cancer and normal cell lines, MethylPurify correctly inferred tumor purity and identified over 96% of the DMRs. From patient data, MethylPurify gave satisfactory DMR calls from tumor methylome samples alone, and revealed potential missed DMRs by tumor to normal comparison due to tumor heterogeneity.

Dynamic evolution of the alpha (alpha) and beta (beta) keratins has accompanied integument diversification and the adaptation of birds into novel lifestyles	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Background: Vertebrate skin appendages are constructed of keratins produced by multigene families. Alpha (alpha) keratins are found in all vertebrates, while beta (beta) keratins are found exclusively in reptiles and birds. We have studied the molecular evolution of these gene families in the genomes of 48 phylogenetically diverse birds and their expression in the scales and feathers of the chicken. Results: We found that the total number of alpha-keratins is lower in birds than mammals and non-avian reptiles, yet two alpha-keratin genes (KRT42 and KRT75) have expanded in birds. The beta-keratins, however, demonstrate a dynamic evolution associated with avian lifestyle. The avian specific feather beta-keratins comprise a large majority of the total number of beta-keratins, but independently derived lineages of aquatic and predatory birds have smaller proportions of feather beta-keratin genes and larger proportions of keratinocyte beta-keratin genes. Additionally, birds of prey have a larger proportion of claw beta-keratins. Analysis of alpha-and beta-keratin expression during development of chicken scales and feathers demonstrates that while alpha-keratins are expressed in these tissues, the number and magnitude of expressed beta-keratin genes far exceeds that of alpha-keratins. Conclusions: These results support the view that the number of alpha-and beta-keratin genes expressed, the proportion of the beta-keratin subfamily genes expressed and the diversification of the beta-keratin genes have been important for the evolution of the feather and the adaptation of birds into multiple ecological niches.

Here we perform whole-genome sequencing of four representative mudskippers to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these adaptations. We discover an expansion of innate immune system genes in the mudskippers that may provide defence against terrestrial pathogens. Several genes of the ammonia excretion pathway in the gills have experienced positive selection, suggesting their important roles in mudskippers' tolerance to environmental ammonia. Some vision-related genes are differentially lost or mutated, illustrating genomic changes associated with aerial vision. Transcriptomic analyses of mudskippers exposed to air highlight regulatory pathways that are up-or down-regulated in response to hypoxia. The present study provides a valuable resource for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying water-to-land transition of vertebrates.

Genomic methylation patterns in archaeological barley show de-methylation as a time-dependent diagenetic process	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Genomic methylation is variable under biotic and abiotic stresses in plants. In particular, viral infection is thought to significantly increase genomic methylation with particularly high activity around transposable elements. Here we present the genomic methylation profiles of grains of archaeological barley (Hordeum vulgare) from several strata from a site in southern Egypt, from the Napatan to the Islamic periods (800 BCE - 1812 CE). One sample tested positive for viral infection and exhibits an unusually high degree of genomic methylation compared to the rest. A decreasing trend in global methylation levels according to deposition date shows in-situ de-methylation of 5-methylcytosine, which can be described as a diagenetic process. This is most likely a deamination mediated de-methylation process and is expected to lead to 5 mC > T base modifications in addition to the C > U modifications due to cytosine deamination, so represents a time-dependent process of DNA diagenesis in ancient DNA.

Assessing patterns of hybridization between North Atlantic eels using diagnostic single-nucleotide polymorphisms	HEREDITY												The two North Atlantic eel species, the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) and the American eel (Anguilla rostrata), spawn in partial sympatry in the Sargasso Sea, providing ample opportunity to interbreed. In this study, we used a RAD (Restriction site Associated DNA) sequencing approach to identify species-specific diagnostic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and design a low-density array that combined with screening of a diagnostic mitochondrial DNA marker. Eels from Iceland (N=159) and from the neighboring Faroe Islands (N=29) were genotyped, along with 94 larvae (49 European and 45 American eel) collected in the Sargasso Sea. Our SNP survey showed that the majority of Icelandic eels are pure European eels but there is also an important contribution of individuals of admixed ancestry (10.7%). Although most of the hybrids were identified as F1 hybrids from European eel female x American eel male crosses, backcrosses were also detected, including a first-generation backcross (F1 hybrid x pure European eel) and three individuals identified as second-generation backcrosses originating from American eel x F1 hybrid backcrosses interbreeding with pure European eels. In comparison, no hybrids were observed in the Faroe Islands, the closest bodies of land to Iceland. It is possible that hybrids show an intermediate migratory behaviour between the two parental species that ultimately brings hybrid larvae to the shores of Iceland, situated roughly halfway between the Sargasso Sea and Europe. Only two hybrids were observed among Sargasso Sea larvae, both backcrosses, but no F1 hybrids, that points to temporal variation in the occurrence of hybridization.

The biosynthesis of paclitaxel had been considered restricted to the Taxus species until it was discovered in Taxomyces andreanae, an endophytic fungus of T. brevifolia. Subsequently, paclitaxel was found in hazel (Corylus avellana L.) and in several other endophytic fungi. The distribution of paclitaxel in plants and endophytic fungi and the reported sequence homology of key genes in paclitaxel biosynthesis between plant and fungi species raises the question about whether the origin of this pathway in these two physically associated groups could have been facilitated by horizontal gene transfer. Results: The ability of the endophytic fungus of hazel Penicillium aurantiogriseum NRRL 62431 to independently synthesize paclitaxel was established by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and proton nuclear magnetic resonance. The genome of Penicillium aurantiogriseum NRRL 62431 was sequenced and gene candidates that may be involved in paclitaxel biosynthesis were identified by comparison with the 13 known paclitaxel biosynthetic genes in Taxus. We found that paclitaxel biosynthetic gene candidates in P. aurantiogriseum NRRL 62431 have evolved independently and that horizontal gene transfer between this endophytic fungus and its plant host is unlikely. Conclusions: Our findings shed new light on how paclitaxel-producing endophytic fungi synthesize paclitaxel, and will facilitate metabolic engineering for the industrial production of paclitaxel from fungi.

However, traditional prenatal diagnosis of CAH relies on genetic testing of fetal genomic DNA obtained using amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling, which is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of a new haplotype-based approach for the noninvasive prenatal testing of CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Parental haplotypes were constructed using target-region sequencing data of the parents and the proband. With the assistance of the parental haplotypes, we recovered fetal haplotypes using a hidden Markov model (HMM) through maternal plasma DNA sequencing. In the genomic region around the CYP21A2 gene, the fetus inherited the paternal haplotype '0' alleles linked to the mutant CYP21A2 gene, but the maternal haplotype '1' alleles linked to the wild-type gene. The fetus was predicted to be an unaffected carrier of CAH, which was confirmed by genetic analysis of fetal genomic DNA from amniotic fluid cells. This method was further validated by comparing the inferred SNP genotypes with the direct sequencing data of fetal genomic DNA. The result showed an accuracy of 96.41% for the inferred maternal alleles and an accuracy of 97.81% for the inferred paternal alleles. The haplotype-based approach is feasible for noninvasive prenatal testing of CAH. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Here we describe an in-depth analysis of noncoding variants based on sequencing data (10,727 cases and 10,582 controls) with replication in an independent cohort of Han Chinese individuals consisting of 4,480 cases and 6,521 controls to identify additional psoriasis susceptibility loci. We confirmed four known psoriasis susceptibility loci (IL12B, IFIH1, ERAP1 and RNF114; 2.30 x 10(-20) <= P <= 2.41 x 10(-7)) and identified three new susceptibility loci: 4q24 (NFKB1) at rs1020760 (P = 2.19 x 10(-8)), 12p13.3 (CD27-LAG3) at rs758739 (P = 4.08 x 10(-8)) and 17q12 (IKZF3) at rs10852936 (P = 1.96 x 10(-8)). Two suggestive loci, 3p21.31 and 17q25, are also identified with P<1.00 x 10(-6). The results of this study increase the number of confirmed psoriasis risk loci and provide novel insight into the pathogenesis of psoriasis.

Transcriptional Pause Release Is a Rate-Limiting Step for Somatic Cell Reprogramming	CELL STEM CELL												Reactivation of the pluripotency network during somatic cell reprogramming by exogenous transcription factors involves chromatin remodeling and the recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to target loci. Here, we report that Pol II is engaged at pluripotency promoters in reprogramming but remains paused and inefficiently released. We also show that bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) stimulates productive transcriptional elongation of pluripotency genes by dissociating the pause release factor P-TEFb from an inactive complex containing HEXIM1. Consequently, BRD4 overexpression enhances reprogramming efficiency and HEXIM1 suppresses it, whereas Brd4 and Hexim1 knockdown do the opposite. We further demonstrate that the reprogramming factor KLF4 helps recruit P-TEFb to pluripotency promoters. Our work thus provides a mechanism for explaining the reactivation of pluripotency genes in reprogramming and unveils an unanticipated role for KLF4 in transcriptional pause release.

MRIs and clinical information were reviewed.Results:Five patients who presented with hypomyelination without the classic basal ganglia abnormalities were found to have novel TUBB4A mutations through whole-exome sequencing. Clinical and imaging characteristics were reviewed suggesting a spectrum of clinical manifestations.Conclusion:Hypomyelinating leukodystrophies remain a diagnostic challenge with a large percentage of unresolved cases. This finding expands the phenotype of TUBB4A-related hypomyelinating conditions beyond hypomyelination with atrophy of the basal ganglia and cerebellum. TUBB4A mutation screening should be considered in cases of isolated hypomyelination or hypomyelination with nonspecific cerebellar atrophy.

Muscle histopathology in nebulin-related nemaline myopathy: ultrastrastructural findings correlated to disease severity and genotype	ACTA NEUROPATHOLOGICA COMMUNICATIONS												Nemaline myopathy (NM) is a rare congenital myopathy characterised by hypotonia, muscle weakness, and often skeletal muscle deformities with the presence of nemaline bodies (rods) in the muscle biopsy. The nebulin (NEB) gene is the most commonly mutated and is thought to account for approximately 50% of genetically diagnosed cases of NM. We undertook a detailed muscle morphological analysis of 14 NEB-mutated NM patients with different clinical forms to define muscle pathological patterns and correlate them with clinical course and genotype. Three groups were identified according to clinical severity. Group 1 (n = 5) comprises severe/lethal NM and biopsy in the first days of life. Group 2 (n = 4) includes intermediate NM and biopsy in infancy. Group 3 (n = 5) comprises typical/mild NM and biopsy in childhood or early adult life. Biopsies underwent histoenzymological, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analysis. Fibre type distribution patterns, rod characteristics, distribution and localization were investigated. Contractile performance was studied in muscle fibre preparations isolated from seven muscle biopsies from each of the three groups. G1 showed significant myofibrillar dissociation and smallness with scattered globular rods in one third of fibres; there was no type 1 predominance. G2 presented milder sarcomeric dissociation, dispersed or clustered nemaline bodies, and type 1 predominance/uniformity. In contrast, G3 had well-delimited clusters of subsarcolemmal elongated rods and type 1 uniformity without sarcomeric alterations. In accordance with the clinical and morphological data, functional studies revealed markedly low forces in muscle bundles from G1 and a better contractile performance in muscle bundles from biopsies of patients from G2, and G3. In conclusion NEB-mutated NM patients present a wide spectrum of morphological features. It is difficult to establish firm genotype phenotype correlation. Interestingly, there was a correlation between clinical severity on the one hand and the degree of sarcomeric dissociation and contractility efficiency on the other. By contrast the percentage of fibres occupied by rods, as well as the quantity and the sub sarcolemmal position of rods, appears to inversely correlate with severity. Based on our observations, we propose myofibrillar dissociation and changes in contractility as an important cause of muscle weakness in NEB-mutated NM patients.				laporte, jocelyn/J-7008-2012; Laporte, Jocelyn/H-6801-2016; Bohm, Johann/O-1652-2016	Pelin, Katarina/0000-0002-7040-7266												2051-5960						2014	2								44	10.1186/2051-5960-2-44								WOS:000422389300044	24725366					J	Wu, J; Wang, DF; Liu, YF; Wang, L; Qiao, X; Zhang, SL				Wu, Jun; Wang, Defu; Liu, Yufeng; Wang, Long; Qiao, Xin; Zhang, Shaoling			Identification of miRNAs involved in pear fruit development and quality	BMC GENOMICS												Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, endogenous RNAs that take part in regulating genes through mediating gene expressions at the post-transcriptional level in plants. Previous studies have reported miRNA identification in various plants ranging from model plants to perennial fruit trees. However, the role of miRNAs in pear (Pyrus bretschneideri) fruit development is not clear. Here, we investigated the miRNA profiles of pear fruits from different time stages during development with Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform and bioinformatics analysis. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to validate the expression levels of miRNAs. Results: Both conserved and species-specific miRNAs in pear have been identified in this study. Total reads, ranging from 19,030,925 to 25,576,773, were obtained from six small RNA libraries constructed for different stages of fruit development after flowering. Comparative profiling showed that an average of 90 miRNAs was expressed with significant differences between various developmental stages. KEGG pathway analysis on 2,216 target genes of 188 known miRNAs and 1,127 target genes of 184 novel miRNAs showed that miRNAs are widely involved in the regulation of fruit development. Among these, a total of eleven miRNAs putatively participate in the pathway of lignin biosynthesis, nine miRNAs were identified to take part in sugar and acid metabolism, and MiR160 was identified to regulate auxin response factor. Conclusion: Comparative analysis of miRNAomes during pear fruit development is presented, and miRNAs were proved to be widely involved in the regulation of fruit development and formation of fruit quality, for example through lignin synthesis, sugar and acid metabolism, and hormone signaling. Combined with computational analysis and experimental confirmation, the research contributes valuable information for further functional research of microRNA in fruit development for pear and other species.																	1471-2164					NOV 3	2014	15								953	10.1186/1471-2164-15-953								WOS:000344889800001	25366381					J	Ruperao, P; Chan, CKK; Azam, S; Karafiatova, M; Hayashi, S; Cizkova, J; Saxena, RK; Simkova, H; Song, C; Vrana, J; Chitikineni, A; Visendi, P; Gaur, PM; Millan, T; Singh, KB; Taran, B; Wang, J; Batley, J; Dolezel, J; Varshney, RK; Edwards, D				Ruperao, Pradeep; Chan, Chon-Kit Kenneth; Azam, Sarwar; Karafiatova, Miroslava; Hayashi, Satomi; Cizkova, Jana; Saxena, Rachit K.; Simkova, Hana; Song, Chi; Vrana, Jan; Chitikineni, Annapurna; Visendi, Paul; Gaur, Pooran M.; Millan, Teresa; Singh, Karam B.; Taran, Bunyamin; Wang, Jun; Batley, Jacqueline; Dolezel, Jaroslav; Varshney, Rajeev K.; Edwards, David			A chromosomal genomics approach to assess and validate the desi and kabuli draft chickpea genome assemblies	PLANT BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL												With the expansion of next-generation sequencing technology and advanced bioinformatics, there has been a rapid growth of genome sequencing projects. However, while this technology enables the rapid and cost-effective assembly of draft genomes, the quality of these assemblies usually falls short of gold standard genome assemblies produced using the more traditional BAC by BAC and Sanger sequencing approaches. Assembly validation is often performed by the physical anchoring of genetically mapped markers, but this is prone to errors and the resolution is usually low, especially towards centromeric regions where recombination is limited. New approaches are required to validate reference genome assemblies. The ability to isolate individual chromosomes combined with next-generation sequencing permits the validation of genome assemblies at the chromosome level. We demonstrate this approach by the assessment of the recently published chickpea kabuli and desi genomes. While previous genetic analysis suggests that these genomes should be very similar, a comparison of their chromosome sizes and published assemblies highlights significant differences. Our chromosomal genomics analysis highlights short defined regions that appear to have been misassembled in the kabuli genome and identifies large-scale misassembly in the draft desi genome. The integration of chromosomal genomics tools within genome sequencing projects has the potential to significantly improve the construction and validation of genome assemblies. The approach could be applied both for new genome assemblies as well as published assemblies, and complements currently applied genome assembly strategies.

Recently, RNA-seq has looked likely to replace microarrays, but there will be a period where both technologies co-exist. This raises two important questions: Can microarray-based models and biomarkers be directly applied to RNA-seq data? Can future RNA-seq-based predictive models and biomarkers be applied to microarray data to leverage past investment? Results: We systematically evaluated the transferability of predictive models and signature genes between microarray and RNA-seq using two large clinical data sets. The complexity of cross-platform sequence correspondence was considered in the analysis and examined using three human and two rat data sets, and three levels of mapping complexity were revealed. Three algorithms representing different modeling complexity were applied to the three levels of mappings for each of the eight binary endpoints and Cox regression was used to model survival times with expression data. In total, 240,096 predictive models were examined. Conclusions: Signature genes of predictive models are reciprocally transferable between microarray and RNA-seq data for model development, and microarray-based models can accurately predict RNA-seq-profiled samples; while RNA-seq-based models are less accurate in predicting microarray-profiled samples and are affected both by the choice of modeling algorithm and the gene mapping complexity. The results suggest continued usefulness of legacy microarray data and established microarray biomarkers and predictive models in the forthcoming RNA-seq era.

The distinctive morphological and physiological features of penguins allow them to live an aquatic life, and some of them have successfully adapted to the hostile environments in Antarctica. To study the phylogenetic and population history of penguins and the molecular basis of their adaptations to Antarctica, we sequenced the genomes of the two Antarctic dwelling penguin species, the Adelie penguin [Pygoscelis adeliae] and emperor penguin [Aptenodytes forsteri]. Results: Phylogenetic dating suggests that early penguins arose similar to 60 million years ago, coinciding with a period of global warming. Analysis of effective population sizes reveals that the two penguin species experienced population expansions from similar to 1 million years ago to similar to 100 thousand years ago, but responded differently to the climatic cooling of the last glacial period. Comparative genomic analyses with other available avian genomes identified molecular changes in genes related to epidermal structure, phototransduction, lipid metabolism, and forelimb morphology. Conclusions: Our sequencing and initial analyses of the first two penguin genomes provide insights into the timing of penguin origin, fluctuations in effective population sizes of the two penguin species over the past 10 million years, and the potential associations between these biological patterns and global climate change. The molecular changes compared with other avian genomes reflect both shared and diverse adaptations of the two penguin species to the Antarctic environment.

As a substrate analog of the folate precursor para-aminobenzoic acid, PAS is ultimately bioactivated to hydroxy dihydrofolate, which inhibits dihydrofolate reductase and disrupts the operation of folate-dependent metabolic pathways. As a result, the mutation of dihydrofolate synthase, an enzyme needed for the bioactivation of PAS, causes PAS resistance in M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv. Here, we demonstrate that various missense mutations within the coding sequence of the dihydropteroate (H(2)Pte) binding pocket of dihydrofolate synthase (FolC) confer PAS resistance in laboratory isolates of M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis. From a panel of 85 multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis clinical isolates, 5 were found to harbor mutations in the folC gene within the H(2)Pte binding pocket, resulting in PAS resistance. While these alterations in the H(2)Pte binding pocket resulted in reduced dihydrofolate synthase activity, they also abolished the bioactivation of hydroxy dihydropteroate to hydroxy dihydrofolate. Consistent with this model for abolished bioactivation, the introduction of a wild-type copy of folC fully restored PAS susceptibility in folC mutant strains. Confirmation of this novel PAS resistance mechanism will be beneficial for the development of molecular method-based diagnostics for M. tuberculosis clinical isolates and for further defining the mode of action of this important tuberculosis drug.

Recent studies provided clues indicating that promoter hypermethylation in cancers might be associated with PRC target genes. Here, we used ChIP-BS-seq to examine methylation of the DNA fragments precipitated by the antibodies to both H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 histone modifications. We showed that, for a set of genes highly enriched with H3K27me3 both in cancer and normal cells, CGI promoters were aberrantly hypermethylated only in cancer cells in comparison with normal cells. In contrast, such aberrant CGI hypermethylation in cancer promoters that were deficient of H3K27me3 was not notable. Furthermore, we confirmed that these genes were consistently hypermethylated in TCGA primary cancer cells. These works support the association between H3K27me3 and DNA methylation marks for specific cancer genes and will spur future work on combined histone and DNA methylation that could define cancer's epigenetic abnormalities.

However, accurate and convenient molecular diagnosis cannot be achieved easily because of the enormous size of the dystrophin gene and complex causative mutation spectrum. Such traditional methods as multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification plus Sanger sequencing require multiple steps to fulfill the diagnosis of DMD/BMD. Here, we introduce a new single-step method for the genetic analysis of DMD patients and female carriers in real clinical settings and demonstrate the validation of its accuracy. A total of 89 patients, 18 female carriers and 245 non-DMD patients were evaluated using our targeted NGS approaches. Compared with traditional methods, our new method yielded 99.99% specificity and 98.96% sensitivity for copy number variations detection and 100% accuracy for the identification of single-nucleotide variation mutations. Additionally, this method is able to detect partial deletions/duplications, thus offering precise personal DMD gene information for gene therapy. We detected novel partial deletions of exons in nine samples for which the breakpoints were located within exonic regions. The results proved that our new method is suitable for routine clinical practice, with shorter turnaround time, higher accuracy, and better insight into comprehensive genetic information (detailed breakpoints) for ensuing gene therapy.

Here we found the strains under 0.93 a(w) exhibited decreased conidiation and aflatoxin biosynthesis compared to that under 0.99 a(w). When RNA-Seq was used to delineate gene expression profile under different water activities, 23,320 non-redundant unigenes, with an average length of 1297 bp, were yielded. By database comparisons, 19,838 unigenes were matched well (e-value < 10(-5)) with known gene sequences, and another 6767 novel unigenes were obtained by comparison to the current genome annotation of A. flavus. Based on the RPKM equation, 5362 differentially expressed unigenes (with vertical bar log(2)Ratio vertical bar >= 1) were identified between 0.99 a(w) and 0.93 a(w) treatments, including 3156 up-regulated and 2206 down-regulated unigenes, suggesting that A. flavus underwent an extensive transcriptome response during water activity variation. Furthermore, we found that the expression of 16 aflatoxin producing-related genes decreased obviously when water activity decreased, and the expression of 11 development-related genes increased after 0.99 a(w) treatment. Our data corroborate a model where water activity affects aflatoxin biosynthesis through increasing the expression of aflatoxin producing-related genes and regulating development-related genes.																	2072-6651					NOV	2014	6	11					3187	3207		10.3390/toxins6113187								WOS:000345531100010	25421810					J	Liang, D; Zhang, ZJ; Wu, HL; Huang, CY; Shuai, P; Ye, CY; Tang, S; Wang, YJ; Yang, L; Wang, J; Yin, WL; Xia, XL				Liang, Dan; Zhang, Zhoujia; Wu, Honglong; Huang, Chunyu; Shuai, Peng; Ye, Chu-Yu; Tang, Sha; Wang, Yunjie; Yang, Ling; Wang, Jun; Yin, Weilun; Xia, Xinli			Single-base-resolution methylomes of populus trichocarpa reveal the association between DNA methylation and drought stress	BMC GENETICS												Background: DNA methylation is an important biological form of epigenetic modification, playing key roles in plant development and environmental responses. Results: In this study, we examined single-base resolution methylomes of Populus under control and drought stress conditions using high-throughput bisulfite sequencing for the first time. Our data showed methylation levels of methylated cytosines, upstream 2kp, downstream 2kb, and repeatitive sequences significantly increased after drought treatment in Populus. Interestingly, methylation in 100 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site (TSS) repressed gene expression, while methylations in 100-2000bp upstream of TSS and within the gene body were positively associated with gene expression. Integrated with the transcriptomic data, we found that all cis-splicing genes were non-methylated, suggesting that DNA methylation may not associate with cis-splicing. However, our results showed that 80% of trans-splicing genes were methylated. Moreover, we found 1156 transcription factors (TFs) with reduced methylation and expression levels and 690 TFs with increased methylation and expression levels after drought treatment. These TFs may play important roles in Populus drought stress responses through the changes of DNA methylation. Conclusions: These findings may provide valuable new insight into our understanding of the interaction between gene expression and methylation of drought responses in Populus.

SS infection may result in septicemia or meningitis in the host. However, little is known about genes that contribute to the virulence process and survival within host blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Small RNAs (sRNA) have emerged as key regulators of virulence in several bacteria, but they have not been investigated in SS. Here, using a differential RNA-sequencing approach and RNAs from SS strain P1/7 grown in rich medium, pig blood, or CSF, we present the SS genome-wide map of 793 transcriptional start sites and 370 operons. In addition to identifying 29 sRNAs, we show that five sRNA deletion mutants attenuate SS virulence in a zebrafish infection model. Homology searches revealed that 10 sRNAs were predicted to be present in other pathogenic Streptococcus species. Compared with wild-type strain P1/7, sRNAs rss03, rss05, and rss06 deletion mutants were significantly more sensitive to killing by pig blood. It is possible that rss06 contributes to SS virulence by indirectly activating expression of SSU0308, a virulence gene encoding a zinc-binding lipoprotein. In blood, genes involved in the synthesis of capsular polysaccharide (CPS) and subversion of host defenses were up-regulated. In contrast, in CSF, genes for CPS synthesis were down-regulated. Our study is the first analysis of SS sRNAs involved in virulence and has both improved our understanding of SS pathogenesis and increased the number of sRNAs known to play definitive roles in bacterial virulence.

A complete ancient RNA genome: identification, reconstruction and evolutionary history of archaeological Barley Stripe Mosaic Virus	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The origins of many plant diseases appear to be recent and associated with the rise of domestication, the spread of agriculture or recent global movements of crops. Distinguishing between these possibilities is problematic because of the difficulty of determining rates of molecular evolution over short time frames. Heterochronous approaches using recent and historical samples show that plant viruses exhibit highly variable and often rapid rates of molecular evolution. The accuracy of estimated evolution rates and age of origin can be greatly improved with the inclusion of older molecular data from archaeological material. Here we present the first reconstruction of an archaeological RNA genome, which is of Barley Stripe Mosaic Virus (BSMV) isolated from barley grain similar to 750 years of age. Phylogenetic analysis of BSMV that includes this genome indicates the divergence of BSMV and its closest relative prior to this time, most likely around 2000 years ago. However, exclusion of the archaeological data results in an apparently much more recent origin of the virus that postdates even the archaeological sample. We conclude that this viral lineage originated in the Near East or North Africa, and spread to North America and East Asia with their hosts along historical trade routes.

Of these, 73 species are currently being rescued from going extinct in wildlife sanctuaries. One of the previously most critically-endangered is the crested ibis, Nipponia nippon. Once widespread across North-East Asia, by 1981 only seven individuals from two breeding pairs remained in the wild. The recovering crested ibis populations thus provide an excellent example for conservation genomics since every individual bird has been recruited for genomic and demographic studies. Results Using high-quality genome sequences of multiple crested ibis individuals, its thriving cohabitant, the little egret, Egretta garzetta, and the recently sequenced genomes of 41 other avian species that are under various degrees of survival threats, including the bald eagle, we carry out comparative analyses for genomic signatures of near extinction events in association with environmental and behavioral attributes of species. We confirm that both loss of genetic diversity and enrichment of deleterious mutations of protein-coding genes contribute to the major genetic defects of the endangered species. We further identify that genetic inbreeding and loss-of-function genes in the crested ibis may all constitute genetic susceptibility to other factors including long-term climate change, over-hunting, and agrochemical overuse. We also establish a genome-wide DNA identification platform for molecular breeding and conservation practices, to facilitate sustainable recovery of endangered species. Conclusions These findings demonstrate common genomic signatures of population decline across avian species and pave a way for further effort in saving endangered species and enhancing conservation genomic efforts.

However, data on invertebrates particularly molluscs are limited, which hinders our understanding of the evolution of DNA methylation in metazoa. The sequencing of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas genome provides an opportunity for genome-wide profiling of DNA methylation in this model mollusc. Results: Homologous searches against the C. gigas genome identified functional orthologs for key genes involved in DNA methylation: DNMT1, DNMT2, DNMT3, MBD2/3 and UHRF1. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) of the oyster's mantle tissues revealed that more than 99% methylation modification was restricted to cytosines in CpG context and methylated CpGs accumulated in the bodies of genes that were moderately expressed. Young repeat elements were another major targets of CpG methylation in oysters. Comparison with other invertebrate methylomes suggested that the 5'-end bias of gene body methylation and the negative correlation between gene body methylation and gene length were the derived features probably limited to the insect lineage. Interestingly, phylostratigraphic analysis showed that CpG methylation preferentially targeted genes originating in the common ancestor of eukaryotes rather than the oldest genes originating in the common ancestor of cellular organisms. Conclusions: Comparative analysis of the oyster DNA methylomes and that of other animal species revealed that the characteristics of DNA methylation were generally conserved during invertebrate evolution, while some unique features were derived in the insect lineage. The preference of methylation modification on genes originating in the eukaryotic ancestor rather than the oldest genes is unexpected, probably implying that the emergence of methylation regulation in these 'relatively young' genes was critical for the origin and radiation of eukaryotes.

Detection of fetal sex chromosome aneuploidy by massively parallel sequencing of maternal plasma DNA: initial experience in a Chinese hospital	ULTRASOUND IN OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY												Objectives To evaluate the performance of a massively parallel sequencing (MPS)-based test in detecting fetal sex chromosome aneuploidy (SCA) and to present a comprehensive clinical counseling protocol for SCA-positive patients. Methods This was a retrospective study in a large patient cohort of 5950 singleton pregnancies which underwent MPS-based testing as a prenatal screening test for trisomies 21, 18 and 13, with X and Y chromosomes as secondary findings, in Southwest Hospital in China. MPS-based SCA-positive women were offered the choice of knowing whether their SCA results were positive and those who did commenced a two-stage post-test clinical counseling protocol. In Stage 1, general information about SCA was given, and women were given the option of invasive testing for confirmation of findings; in Stage 2, those who had chosen to undergo invasive testing were informed about the specific SCA affecting their fetus and their management options. Results Thirty-three cases were classified as SCA-positive by MPS-based testing. After Stage 1 of the two-stage post-test clinical counseling session, 33 (100%) of these pregnant women chose to know the screening test results, and 25 (75.76%) underwent an invasive diagnostic procedure and karyotype analysis, in one of whom karyotyping failed. In thirteen cases, karyotyping confirmed the MPS-based test results (two X0 cases, seven XXX cases, three XXY cases and one XYY case), giving a positive predictive value of 54.17% (13/24 cases confirmed by karyotyping). After post-test clinical counseling session Stage 2, seven women chose to terminate the pregnancy: one X0 case, two XXX cases, the three XXY cases and the single XYY case. Six women decided to continue with pregnancy: one X0 case and five XXX cases. Conclusion Our study showed the feasibility of clinical application of the MPS-based test in the non-invasive detection of fetal SCA. Together with a two-stage post-test clinical counseling protocol, it leads to a well-informed decision-making procedure. Copyright (C) 2014 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Development and Validation of a New HPV Genotyping Assay Based on Next-Generation Sequencing	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PATHOLOGY												Objectives: We developed a new human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping assay based on multiplex polymerase chain reaction and next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods for large-scale cervical cancer screening. Methods: We first trained the assay on 1,170 self-collected samples, balancing the cutoff points for high-risk types. Then using 4,262 separate self-collected specimens, we compared concordance, sensitivity, and specificity for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia type 2 (CIN2) or higher and CIN type 3 (CIN3) or higher of the HPV sequencing assay with that of Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) direct samples and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry assay self-samples. Results: All assays had a good agreement. The sensitivity for CIN2 or higher and CIN3 or higher of the self-sampling specimens tested with the sequencing assay run on both MiSeq and Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine sequencer was similar to that of direct-sampling specimens tested with HC2 (P > .05), but the specificity of the sequencing assay for CIN2 or higher and CIN3 or higher was significantly higher than that of HC2 (P < .01). Conclusions: This population-based study has demonstrated the applicability of a new NGS high-risk HPV assay for primary cervical cancer screening based on self-collection.																	0002-9173	1943-7722				JUN	2014	141	6					796	804		10.1309/AJCP9P2KJSXEKCJB								WOS:000336239800007	24838323					J	Azim, MK; Khan, IA; Zhang, Y				Azim, M.

The RNA-seq output of mango transcriptome generated > 12 million reads (total nucleotides sequenced > 1 Gb). De novo transcriptome assembly generated 30,509 unigenes with lengths in the range of 300 to a parts per thousand yen3,000 nt and 67x depth of coverage. Blast searching against nonredundant nucleotide databases and several Viridiplantae genomic datasets annotated 24,593 mango unigenes (80 % of total) and identified Citrus sinensis as closest neighbor of mango with 9,141 (37 %) matched sequences. The annotation with gene ontology and Clusters of Orthologous Group terms categorized unigene sequences into 57 and 25 classes, respectively. More than 13,500 unigenes were assigned to 293 KEGG pathways. Besides major plant biology related pathways, KEGG based gene annotation pointed out active presence of an array of biochemical pathways involved in (a) biosynthesis of bioactive flavonoids, flavones and flavonols, (b) biosynthesis of terpenoids and lignins and (c) plant hormone signal transduction. The mango transcriptome sequences revealed 235 proteases belonging to five catalytic classes of proteolytic enzymes. The draft genome of mango chloroplast (cp) was obtained by a combination of Sanger and next generation sequencing. The draft mango cp genome size is 151,173 bp with a pair of inverted repeats of 27,093 bp separated by small and large single copy regions, respectively. Out of 139 genes in mango cp genome, 91 found to be protein coding. Sequence analysis revealed cp genome of C. sinensis as closest neighbor of mango. We found 51 short repeats in mango cp genome supposed to be associated with extensive rearrangements. This is the first report of transcriptome and chloroplast genome analysis of any Anacardiaceae family member.																	0167-4412	1573-5028				MAY	2014	85	1-2					193	208		10.1007/s11103-014-0179-8								WOS:000335756900014	24515595					J	Fernandez-Banet, J; Lee, NP; Chan, KT; Gao, H; Liu, X; Sung, WK; Tan, WN; Fan, ST; Poon, RT; Li, SY; Ching, K; Rejto, PA; Mao, M; Kan, ZY				Fernandez-Banet, Julio; Lee, Nikki P.; Chan, Kin Tak; Gao, Huan; Liu, Xiao; Sung, Wing-Kin; Tan, Winnie; Fan, Sheung Tat; Poon, Ronnie T.; Li, Shiyong; Ching, Keith; Rejto, Paul A.; Mao, Mao; Kan, Zhengyan			Decoding complex patterns of genomic rearrangement in hepatocellular carcinoma	GENOMICS												Elucidating the molecular basis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is crucial to developing targeted diagnostics and therapies for this deadly disease. The landscape of somatic genomic rearrangements (GRs), which can lead to oncogenic gene fusions, remains poorly characterized in HCC. We have predicted 4314 GRs including large-scale insertions, deletions, inversions and translocations based on the whole-genome sequencing data for 88 primary HCC tumor/non-tumor tissues. We identified chromothripsis in 5 HCC genomes (5.7%) recurrently affecting chromosomal arms 1q and 8q. Albumin (ALB) was found to harbor GRs, deactivating mutations and deletions in 10% of cohort Integrative analysis identified a pattern of paired intra-chromosomal translocations flanking focal amplifications and asymmetrical patterns of copy number variation flanking breakpoints of translocations. Furthermore, we predicted 260 gene fusions which frequently result in aberrant over-expression of the 3' genes in tumors and validated 18 gene fusions, including recurrent fusion (2/88) of ABCB11 and LRP2.

Methods: We used whole-genome sequencing at 33X-43X coverage to profile somatic mutations in primary HCC (HBV+) and metachronous lung metastases (> 2 years interval). Results: In total, 5,027-13,961 and 5,275-12,624 somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) were detected in primary HCC and lung metastases, respectively. Generally, 38.88-78.49% of SNVs detected in metastases were present in primary tumors. We identified 65-221 structural variations (SVs) in primary tumors and 60-232 SVs in metastases. Comparison of these SVs shows very similar and largely overlapped mutated segments between primary and metastatic tumors. Copy number alterations between primary and metastatic pairs were also found to be closely related. Together, these preservations in genomic profiles from liver primary tumors to metachronous lung metastases indicate that the genomic features during tumorigenesis may be retained during metastasis. Conclusions: We found very similar genomic alterations between primary and metastatic tumors, with a few mutations found specifically in lung metastases, which may explain the clinical observation that both primary and metastatic tumors are usually sensitive or resistant to the same systemic treatments.

Methods: We recruited a pregnant woman and her spouse, who had a proband child suffering from congenital deafness, and obtained the target-region sequencing data from a semicustom array that used genomic and-maternal plasma DNA from three generations of this family. A haplotype-assisted strategy was developed to detect whether the fetus inherited the pathogenic mutations in the causative gene, GJB2. The parental haplotype was constructed using a trio strategy through two different processes, namely, the grandparent-assisted haplotype phasing process and the proband-assisted haplotype phasing process. The fetal haplotype was deduced afterward based on both the maternal plasma sequencing data and the parental haplotype. Results: The accuracy levels of paternal and maternal haplotypes obtained by grandparent-assisted haplotype phasing were 99.01 and 97.36%, respectively, and the proband-assisted haplotype phasing process yielded slightly lower accuracies of 98.73 and 96.79%, respectively. Fetal inheritance of the pathogenic gene was deduced correctly in both processes. Conclusion: Our study indicates that the strategy of haplotype, based noninvasive prenatal testing for monogenic conditions has potential applications in clinical practice.																	1098-3600	1530-0366				DEC	2014	16	12					972	976		10.1038/gim.2014.51								WOS:000346040900016	24830326					J	Jing, LP; Zhong, XM; Zhong, ZY; Huang, WH; Liu, Y; Yang, G; Zhang, XP; Zou, J; Jing, CX; Wei, XC				Jing, Lipeng; Zhong, Xingming; Zhong, Zeyan; Huang, Weihuang; Liu, Yang; Yang, Guang; Zhang, Xiaoping; Zou, Jing; Jing, Chunxia; Wei, Xiangcai			Prevalence of Human Papillomavirus Infection in Guangdong Province, China: A Population-Based Survey of 78,355 Women	SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES												Background: The prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and the distribution of different HPV genotypes vary greatly within different geographical and ethnic populations, especially in Asia. The HPV infection data based on regional population are extremely important for researchers to develop new efficient HPV screening assays and estimate the effect of vaccines on preventing from cervical cancer. Methods: A total of 78,355 women from Guangdong Province, China, whose ages were from 18 to 75 years were enrolled in this study. All epidemiological datawere obtained by face-to-face interview. Cervical exfoliated cells were collected, and HPV-DNA test was conducted with the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of flight mass spectrometry. Results: The overall HPV infection prevalence in the study population was 7.3%. The top 6 HPV genotypes were HPV16 (1.5%), HPV52 (1.2%), HPV58 (1.0%), HPV18 (0.7%), HPV45 (0.5%), and HPV6 (0.5%), accounting for 69.7% of all detected HPV infection types. Two peaks of HPV infection were detected in the population of old age group (>50; 9.6%) and young group (<25; 8.2%). Infection with single genotype HPV (6.2% in all; 85.7% in HPV-positive women) was more frequent than infection with multiple HPV (1.0% and 14.3% respectively). Results of multivariate logistic regression revealed that sexual active years, numbers of sexual partner, and numbers of pregnancy were risk factors of HPV infection. Conclusions: This study provides useful epidemiological information on cervical HPV infection prevalence in general female population from Guangdong Province, China. In this population, HPV infection prevalence was 7.3%, and genotypes HPV16, HPV52, and HPV58 showed a relatively high prevalence.																	0148-5717	1537-4521				DEC	2014	41	12					725	731		10.1097/OLQ.0000000000000201								WOS:000345291900006	25581810					J	Jacobsen, MW; Pujolar, JM; Bernatchez, L; Munch, K; Jian, JB; Niu, YC; Hansen, MM				Jacobsen, Magnus W.; Pujolar, Jose Martin; Bernatchez, Louis; Munch, Kasper; Jian, Jianbo; Niu, Yongchao; Hansen, Michael M.			Genomic footprints of speciation in Atlantic eels (Anguilla anguilla and A. rostrata)	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												The importance of speciation-with-geneflow scenarios is increasingly appreciated. However, the specific processes and the resulting genomic footprints of selection are subject to much discussion. We studied the genomics of speciation between the two panmictic, sympatrically spawning sister species; European (Anguilla anguilla) and American eel (A.rostrata). Divergence is assumed to have initiated more than 3Ma, and although low gene flow still occurs, strong postzygotic barriers are present. Restriction-site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing identified 328300 SNPs for subsequent analysis. However, despite the presence of 3757 strongly differentiated SNPs (F-ST>0.8), sliding window analyses of F-ST showed no larger genomic regions (i.e. hundreds of thousands to millions of bases) of elevated differentiation. Overall F-ST was 0.041, and linkage disequilibrium was virtually absent for SNPs separated by more than 1000bp. We suggest this to reflect a case of genomic hitchhiking, where multiple regions are under directional selection between the species. However, low but biologically significant gene flow and high effective population sizes leading to very low genetic drift preclude accumulation of strong background differentiation. Genes containing candidate SNPs for positive selection showed significant enrichment for gene ontology (GO) terms relating to developmental processes and phosphorylation, which seems consistent with assumptions that differences in larval phase duration and migratory distances underlie speciation. Most SNPs under putative selection were found outside coding regions, lending support to emerging views that noncoding regions may be more functionally important than previously assumed. In total, the results demonstrate the necessity of interpreting genomic footprints of selection in the context of demographic parameters and life-history features of the studied species.

Of the disease resistance gene families, the nucleotide-binding site plus leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) family is the most prevalent and ancient and is also one of the largest gene families known in plants. The sequence diversity in NBS-encoding genes was explored in sorghum, a critical food staple in Africa, with comparisons to rice and maize and with comparisons to fungal pathogen resistance QTL. Results: In sorghum, NBS-encoding genes had significantly higher diversity in comparison to non NBS-encoding genes and were significantly enriched in regions of the genome under purifying and balancing selection, both through domestication and improvement. Ancestral genes, pre-dating species divergence, were more abundant in regions with signatures of selection than in regions not under selection. Sorghum NBS-encoding genes were also significantly enriched in the regions of the genome containing fungal pathogen disease resistance QTL; with the diversity of the NBS-encoding genes influenced by the type of co-locating biotic stress resistance QTL. Conclusions: NBS-encoding genes are under strong selection pressure in sorghum, through the contrasting evolutionary processes of purifying and balancing selection. Such contrasting evolutionary processes have impacted ancestral genes more than species-specific genes. Fungal disease resistance hot-spots in the genome, with resistance against multiple pathogens, provides further insight into the mechanisms that cereals use in the "arms race" with rapidly evolving pathogens in addition to providing plant breeders with selection targets for fast-tracking the development of high performing varieties with more durable pathogen resistance.

The aim of this study was to identify the gene responsible for glomerulopathy in a 4-generation Chinese pedigree. Exome sequencing was conducted in four patients of the family, and then direct sequencing was performed in other members of the pedigree. A novel missense mutation c.368G > A (p.Gly123Glu) in the collagen type IV alpha-5 gene (COL4A5) was found to be the genetic cause. The p.Gly123Glu mutation occurs prior to Gly-X-Y repeats in the alpha-5 chain of type IV collagen. Neither sensorineural hearing loss nor ocular abnormalities were present in patients of this family. Other clinical features, such as age of onset, age of ESRD, disease severity and complications, varied among patients of this family. Our finding may provide new insights into the cause and diagnosis of AS, and also have implications for genetic counseling.

Lipidomic profiling before and after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in obese patients with diabetes	PHARMACOGENOMICS JOURNAL												Bariatric surgery is a well-established approach to improve metabolic disease in morbidly obese patients with high cardiovascular risk. The post-operative normalization of lipid metabolism has a central role in the prevention of future cardiovascular events. The aim of the present study therefore was to characterize changes of plasma lipidomic patterns, consisting of 229 lipid species of 13 lipid classes, 3 months after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in morbidly obese patients with and without diabetes. RYGB resulted in a 15-32% decrease of body mass index, which was associated with a significant reduction of total cholesterol (TC, 28.3%; P=0.02), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C, -26.8%; P=0.03) and triglycerides (TGs, -63.0%; P= 0.05) measured by routine clinical chemistry. HDL-cholesterol remained unchanged. The effect of RYGB on the plasma lipidomic profile was characterized by significant decreases of 87 lipid species from triacylglycerides (TAGs), cholesterol esters (CholEs), lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs), phosphatidylcholines (PCs), phosphatidylethanolamine ethers (PEOs), phosphatidylinositols (Pis) and ceramides (Cers). The total of plasma lipid components exhibited a substantial decline of 32.6% and 66 lipid species showed a decrease by over 50%. A direct correlation with HbAlc values could be demonstrated for 24 individual lipid species (10 TAG, three CholE, two LPC, one lysophosphatidylcholine ethers (LPCO) (LPC ether), one PC, two phosphatidylcholine ethers (PCO) and five Cer). Notably, two lipid species (TAG 58:5 and PEO 40:5) were inversely correlated with HbA(1c). LPCO, as single whole lipid class, was directly related to HbA(1c). These data indicate that RYGB-induced modulation of lipidomic profiles provides important information about postoperative metabolic adaptations and might substantially contribute to improvements of glycemic control. These striking changes in the human plasma lipidome may explain acute, weight independent and long-term effects of RYGB on the cardiovascular system, mental status and immune regulation.

Due to a lack of comparable genome-scale sequence data, far less is known about endogenous viral elements in avian species, even though their small genomes may enable important insights into the patterns and processes of endogenous viral element evolution. Results: Through a systematic screening of the genomes of 48 species sampled across the avian phylogeny we reveal that birds harbor a limited number of endogenous viral elements compared to mammals, with only five viral families observed: Retroviridae, Hepadnaviridae, Bornaviridae, Circoviridae, and Parvoviridae. All nonretroviral endogenous viral elements are present at low copy numbers and in few species, with only endogenous hepadnaviruses widely distributed, although these have been purged in some cases. We also provide the first evidence for endogenous bornaviruses and circoviruses in avian genomes, although at very low copy numbers. A comparative analysis of vertebrate genomes revealed a simple linear relationship between endogenous viral element abundance and host genome size, such that the occurrence of endogenous viral elements in bird genomes is 6- to 13-fold less frequent than in mammals. Conclusions: These results reveal that avian genomes harbor relatively small numbers of endogenous viruses, particularly those derived from RNA viruses, and hence are either less susceptible to viral invasions or purge them more effectively.

To characterize all of the missing proteins, we applied an OMICS-integrated analysis of three human liver cell lines (HeP3B, MHCC97H, and HCCLM3) using mRNA and ribosome nascent-chain complex-bound mRNA deep sequencing and proteome profiling, contributing mass spectrometric evidence of 60 additional chromosome 1 gene products. Integration of the annotation information from public databases revealed that 84.6% of genes on chromosome I had high-confidence protein evidence. Hierarchical analysis demonstrated that the remaining 320 missing genes were either experimentally or biologically explainable; 128 genes were found to be tissue-specific or rarely expressed in some tissues, whereas 91 proteins were uncharacterized mainly due to database annotation, diversity, 89 were genes with low mRNA abundance or unsuitable protein properties, and 12 genes were identifiable theoretically because of a high abundance of mRNAs/RNC-mRNAs and the existence of proteotypic peptides. The relatively large contribution made by the identification of enriched transcription factors suggested specific enrichment of low-abundance protein classes, and SRM/MRM could capture high-priority missing proteins. Detailed analyses of the differentially expressed genes indicated that several gene families located on chromosome 1 may play critical roles in mediating hepatocellular carcinoma invasion and metastasis. All mass spectrometry proteomics data corresponding to tour study were deposited in the ProteomeXchange under the identifiers PXD000529, PXD000S33, and PXD000535.

Epidemiologic studies have shown that the abnormal telomere length in leukocytes is associated with some mental disorders and age-related diseases. However, the association between leukocyte telomere length and autism has not been investigated. Here we investigated the possible association between relative telomere length (RTL) in peripheral blood leukocytes and childhood autism by using an established real-time polymerase chain reaction method. We observed significantly shorter RTL in patients with childhood autism than in controls (p=0.006). Individuals with shorter RTL had a significantly increased presence of childhood autism compared with those who had long RTL. In patients, we found that family training interventions have a significant effect on telomere length (P=0.012), but no correlations between RTL and clinical features (paternal age, maternal age, age of onset, illness of duration, CARS score and ABC score) were observed in this study. These results provided the first evidence that shorter leukocytes telomere length is significantly associated with childhood autism. The molecular mechanism underlying telomere length may be implicated in the development of autism.

Recent studies suggest that RNA editing might enhance the diversity of gene products at the post-transcriptional level, particularly to induce functional changes in the nervous system. Using head samples from the leaf-cutting ant Acromyrmex echinatior, we compare RNA editomes across eusocial castes, identifying ca. 11,000 RNA editing sites in gynes, large workers and small workers. Those editing sites map to 800 genes functionally enriched for neurotransmission, circadian rhythm, temperature response, RNA splicing and carboxylic acid biosynthesis. Most A. echinatior editing sites are species specific, but 8-23% are conserved across ant subfamilies and likely to have been important for the evolution of eusociality in ants. The level of editing varies for the same site between castes, suggesting that RNA editing might be a general mechanism that shapes caste behaviour in ants.

We hypothesized that changes in gene methylation is involved in the prenatal maturation of the intestine and its response to the first days of formula feeding, potentially leading to NEC in preterm pigs used as models for preterm infants. Results: Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) was used to assess if changes in intestinal DNA methylation are associated with formula-induced NEC outbreak and advancing age from 10 days before birth to 4 days after birth. Selected key genes with differentially methylated gene regions (DMRs) between groups were further validated by HiSeq-based bisulfite sequencing PCR and RT-qPCR to assess methylation and expression levels. Consistent with the maturation of many intestinal functions in the perinatal period, methylation level of most genes decreased with advancing pre- and postnatal age. The highest number of DMRs was identified between the newborn and 4 d-old preterm pigs. There were few intestinal DMR differences between unaffected pigs and pigs with initial evidence of NEC. In the 4 d-old formula-fed preterm pigs, four genes associated with intestinal metabolism (CYP2W1, GPR146, TOP1MT, CEND1) showed significant hyper-methylation in their promoter CGIs, and thus, down-regulated transcription. Methylation-driven down-regulation of such genes may predispose the immature intestine to later metabolic dysfunctions and severe NEC lesions. Conclusions: Pre- and postnatal changes in intestinal DNA methylation may contribute to high NEC sensitivity in preterm neonates. Optimizing gene methylation changes via environmental stimuli (e.g. diet, nutrition, gut microbiota), may help to make immature newborn infants more resistant to gut dysfunctions, both short and long term.

Although natural language Processing (NLP) methods have been profoundly studied in electronic medical records (EMR), few studies have explored NLP in extracting information from Chinese clinical narratives. In this study, we report the development and evaluation of extracting tumor-related information from operation notes of hepatic carcinomas which were written in Chinese. Using 86 operation notes manually annotated by physicians as the training set, we explored both rule-based and supervised machine-learning approaches. Evaluating on unseen 29 operation notes, our best approach yielded 69.6% in precision, 58.3% in recall and 63.5% F-score. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

These clinical applications, especially prenatal diagnosis, have a strict requirement of turn-around-time; therefore, the application of ULCS is restricted by current high throughput sequencing platforms. Recently, the emergence of rapid sequencing platforms, such as MiSeq and Ion Proton, brings ULCS strategy into a new era. The comparison of their performance could shed lights on their potential application in large-scale clinic trials. In this study, we performed ULCS (, 0.1X coverage) on both MiSeq and Ion Proton platforms for 18 spontaneous abortion fetuses carrying aneuploidy and compared their performance on different levels. Overall basic data and GC bias showed no significant difference between these two platforms. We also found the sex and aneuploidy detection indicated 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity on both platforms. Our study generated essential data from these two rapid sequencing platforms, which provides useful reference for later research and potentially accelerates the clinical applications of ULCS.																	1932-6203					MAR 20	2014	9	3							e92192	10.1371/journal.pone.0092192								WOS:000333352800081	24651575					J	Gao, R; Liu, YX; Gjesing, AP; Hollensted, M; Wan, XZ; He, SW; Pedersen, O; Yi, X; Wang, J; Hansen, T				Gao, Rui; Liu, Yanxia; Gjesing, Anette Prior; Hollensted, Mette; Wan, Xianzi; He, Shuwen; Pedersen, Oluf; Yi, Xin; Wang, Jun; Hansen, Torben			Evaluation of a target region capture sequencing platform using monogenic diabetes as a study-model	BMC GENETICS												Background: Monogenic diabetes is a genetic disease often caused by mutations in genes involved in beta-cell function. Correct sub-categorization of the disease is a prerequisite for appropriate treatment and genetic counseling. Target-region capture sequencing is a combination of genomic region enrichment and next generation sequencing which might be used as an efficient way to diagnose various genetic disorders. We aimed to develop a target-region capture sequencing platform to screen 117 selected candidate genes involved in metabolism for mutations and to evaluate its performance using monogenic diabetes as a study-model. Results: The performance of the assay was evaluated in 70 patients carrying known disease causing mutations previously identified in HNF4A, GCK, HNF1A, HNF1B, INS, or KCNJ11. Target regions with a less than 20-fold sequencing depth were either introns or UTRs. When only considering translated regions, the coverage was 100% with a 50-fold minimum depth. Among the 70 analyzed samples, 63 small size single nucleotide polymorphisms and indels as well as 7 large deletions and duplications were identified as being the pathogenic variants. The mutations identified by the present technique were identical with those previously identified through Sanger sequencing and Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification. Conclusions: We hereby demonstrated that the established platform as an accurate and high-throughput gene testing method which might be useful in the clinical diagnosis of monogenic diabetes.

Dynamic transcriptome analysis of D. radiodurans cells using strand-specific RNA sequencing (ssRNA-seq), combined with LC-MS based metabolite analysis, allowed an estimate of the immediate expression pattern of genes and antioxidants in response to irradiation. Transcriptome dynamics were examined in cells by ssRNA-seq covering its predicted genes. Of the 144 non-coding RNAs that were annotated, 49 of these were transfer RNAs and 95 were putative novel antisense RNAs. Genes differentially expressed during irradiation and recovery included those involved in DNA repair, degradation of damaged proteins and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolism. The knockout mutant crtB (phytoene synthase gene) was unable to produce carotenoids, and exhibited a decreased survival rate after irradiation, suggesting a role for these pigments in radiation resistance. Network components identified in this study, including repair and metabolic genes and antioxidants, provided new insights into the complex mechanism of radiation resistance in D. radiodurans.

The South Asian Genome	PLOS ONE												The genetic sequence variation of people from the Indian subcontinent who comprise one-quarter of the world's population, is not well described. We carried out whole genome sequencing of 168 South Asians, along with whole-exome sequencing of 147 South Asians to provide deeper characterisation of coding regions. We identify 12,962,155 autosomal sequence variants, including 2,946,861 new SNPs and 312,738 novel indels. This catalogue of SNPs and indels amongst South Asians provides the first comprehensive map of genetic variation in this major human population, and reveals evidence for selective pressures on genes involved in skin biology, metabolism, infection and immunity. Our results will accelerate the search for the genetic variants underlying susceptibility to disorders such as type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease which are highly prevalent amongst South Asians.

Deep Sequencing of HIV-Infected Cells: Insights into Nascent Transcription and Host-Directed Therapy	JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY												Polyadenylated mature mRNAs are the focus of standard transcriptome analyses. However, the profiling of nascent transcripts, which often include nonpolyadenylated RNAs, can unveil novel insights into transcriptional regulation. Here, we separately sequenced total RNAs (Total RNAseq) and mRNAs (mRNAseq) from the same HIV-1-infected human CD4(+) T cells. We found that many nonpolyadenylated RNAs were differentially expressed upon HIV-1 infection, and we identified 8 times more differentially expressed genes at 12 h postinfection by Total RNAseq than by mRNAseq. These expression changes were also evident by concurrent changes in introns and were recapitulated by later mRNA changes, revealing an unexpectedly significant delay between transcriptional initiation and mature mRNA production early after HIV-1 infection. We computationally derived and validated the underlying regulatory programs, and we predicted drugs capable of reversing these HIV-1-induced expression changes followed by experimental confirmation. Our results show that combined total and mRNA transcriptome analysis is essential for fully capturing the early host response to virus infection and provide a framework for identifying candidate drugs for host-directed therapy against HIV/AIDS.

However, it remains largely unknown that whether metastatic renal cell carcinomas (mRCCs) also have startling intratumoral heterogeneity or whether development of mRCCs is due to early dissemination or late diagnosis. To decipher the evolution of mRCC, we analyzed the multilayered molecular profiles of pRCC, local invasion of the vena cava (IVC), and distant metastasis to the brain (MB) from the same patient using whole-genome sequencing, whole-exome sequencing, DNA methylome profiling, and transcriptome sequencing. We found that mRCC had a lower degree of heterogeneity than pRCC and was likely to result from recent clonal expansion of a rare, advantageous subclone. Consequently, some key pathways that are targeted by clinically available drugs showed distinct expression patterns between pRCC and mRCC. From the genetic distances between different tumor subclones, we estimated that the progeny subclone giving rise to distant metastasis took over half a decade to acquire the full potential of metastasis since the birth of the subclone that evolved into IVC. Our evidence supported that mRCC was monoclonal and distant metastasis occurred late during renal cancer progression. Thus, there was a broad window for early detection of circulating tumor cells and future targeted treatments for patients with mRCCs should rely on the molecular profiles of metastases.																	0020-7136	1097-0215				JUL 1	2014	135	1					78	87		10.1002/ijc.28654								WOS:000334353500009	24310851					J	Dong, ZR; Jiang, LP; Yang, CC; Hu, H; Wang, XH; Chen, HX; Choy, KW; Hu, HM; Dong, YL; Hu, B; Xu, JC; Long, Y; Cao, SJ; Chen, H; Wang, WJ; Jiang, H; Xu, FP; Yao, H; Xu, X; Liang, ZQ				Dong, Zirui; Jiang, Lupin; Yang, Chuanchun; Hu, Hua; Wang, Xiuhua; Chen, Haixiao; Choy, Kwong Wai; Hu, Huamei; Dong, Yanling; Hu, Bin; Xu, Juchun; Long, Yang; Cao, Sujie; Chen, Hui; Wang, Wen-Jing; Jiang, Hui; Xu, Fengping; Yao, Hong; Xu, Xun; Liang, Zhiqing			A Robust Approach for Blind Detection of Balanced Chromosomal Rearrangements with Whole-Genome Low-Coverage Sequencing	HUMAN MUTATION												Balanced chromosomal rearrangement (or balanced chromosome abnormality, BCA) is a common chromosomal structural variation. Next-generation sequencing has been reported to detect BCA-associated breakpoints with the aid of karyotyping. However, the complications associated with this approach and the requirement for cytogenetics information has limited its application. Here, we provide a whole-genome low-coverage sequencing approach to detect BCA events independent of knowing the affected regions and with low false positives. First, six samples containing BCAs were used to establish a detection protocol and assess the efficacy of different library construction approaches. By clustering anomalous read pairs and filtering out the false-positive results with a control cohort and the concomitant mapping information, we could directly detect BCA events for each sample. Through optimizing the read depth, BCAs in all samples could be blindly detected with only 120 million read pairs per sample for data from a small-insert library and 30 million per sample for data from nonsize-selected mate-pair library. This approach was further validated using another 13 samples that contained BCAs. Our approach advances the application of high-throughput whole-genome low-coverage analysis for robust BCA detectionespecially for clinical sampleswithout the need for karyotyping.																	1059-7794	1098-1004				MAY	2014	35	5					625	636		10.1002/humu.22541								WOS:000334658800016	24610732					J	Kidd, JM; Sharpton, TJ; Bobo, D; Norman, PJ; Martin, AR; Carpenter, ML; Sikora, M; Gignoux, CR; Nemat-Gorgani, N; Adams, A; Guadalupe, M; Guo, XS; Feng, Q; Li, YR; Liu, X; Parham, P; Hoal, EG; Feldman, MW; Pollard, KS; Wall, JD; Bustamante, CD; Henn, BM				Kidd, Jeffrey M.; Sharpton, Thomas J.; Bobo, Dean; Norman, Paul J.; Martin, Alicia R.; Carpenter, Meredith L.; Sikora, Martin; Gignoux, Christopher R.; Nemat-Gorgani, Neda; Adams, Alexandra; Guadalupe, Moraima; Guo, Xiaosen; Feng, Qiang; Li, Yingrui; Liu, Xiao; Parham, Peter; Hoal, Eileen G.; Feldman, Marcus W.; Pollard, Katherine S.; Wall, Jeffrey D.; Bustamante, Carlos D.; Henn, Brenna M.			Exome capture from saliva produces high quality genomic and metagenomic data	BMC GENOMICS												Background: Targeted capture of genomic regions reduces sequencing cost while generating higher coverage by allowing biomedical researchers to focus on specific loci of interest, such as exons. Targeted capture also has the potential to facilitate the generation of genomic data from DNA collected via saliva or buccal cells. DNA samples derived from these cell types tend to have a lower human DNA yield, may be degraded from age and/or have contamination from bacteria or other ambient oral microbiota. However, thousands of samples have been previously collected from these cell types, and saliva collection has the advantage that it is a non-invasive and appropriate for a wide variety of research. Results: We demonstrate successful enrichment and sequencing of 15 South African KhoeSan exomes and 2 full genomes with samples initially derived from saliva. The expanded exome dataset enables us to characterize genetic diversity free from ascertainment bias for multiple KhoeSan populations, including new exome data from six HGDP Namibian San, revealing substantial population structure across the Kalahari Desert region. Additionally, we discover and independently verify thirty-one previously unknown KIR alleles using methods we developed to accurately map and call the highly polymorphic HLA and KIR loci from exome capture data. Finally, we show that exome capture of saliva-derived DNA yields sufficient non-human sequences to characterize oral microbial communities, including detection of bacteria linked to oral disease (e. g. Prevotella melaninogenica). For comparison, two samples were sequenced using standard full genome library preparation without exome capture and we found no systematic bias of metagenomic information between exome-captured and non-captured data. Conclusions: DNA from human saliva samples, collected and extracted using standard procedures, can be used to successfully sequence high quality human exomes, and metagenomic data can be derived from non-human reads. We find that individuals from the Kalahari carry a higher oral pathogenic microbial load than samples surveyed in the Human Microbiome Project. Additionally, rare variants present in the exomes suggest strong population structure across different KhoeSan populations.

Here, we report results of WES and functional validation in a consanguineous Indian kindred where two siblings presented with profound developmental delay, congenital hypotonia, refractory epilepsy, abnormal myelination, fluctuating basal ganglia changes, cerebral atrophy, and reduced N-acetylaspartate (NAA). Methods: Whole blood DNA from one affected and one unaffected sibling was captured by Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon kit and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq2000. Mutations were validated by Sanger sequencing in all family members. Protein from wild-type and mutant fibroblasts was isolated to assess mutation effects on protein expression and enzyme activity. Results: A novel SLC25A12 homozygous missense mutation, c.1058G>A; p.Arg353Gln, segregated with disease in this kindred. SLC25A12 encodes the neuronal aspartate-glutamate carrier 1 (AGC1) protein, an essential component of the neuronal malate/aspartate shuttle that transfers NADH and H+ reducing equivalents from the cytosol to mitochondria. AGC1 activity enables neuronal export of aspartate, the glial substrate necessary for proper neuronal myelination. Recombinant mutant p.Arg353Gln AGC1 activity was reduced to 15% of wild type. One prior reported SLC25A12 mutation caused complete loss of AGC1 activity in a child with epilepsy, hypotonia, hypomyelination, and reduced brain NAA. Conclusions: These data strongly suggest that SLC25A12 disease impairs neuronal AGC1 activity. SLC25A12 sequencing should be considered in children with infantile epilepsy, congenital hypotonia, global delay, abnormal myelination, and reduced brain NAA.				lasorsa, francesco massimo/B-7931-2008; Guo, Yiran/H-4120-2011	lasorsa, francesco massimo/0000-0001-8418-5222; Guo, Yiran/0000-0002-6549-8589												2192-8304		978-3-662-43748-3; 978-3-662-43747-6				2014	14						77	85		10.1007/8904_2013_287	10.1007/978-3-662-43748-3							WOS:000376977100012	24515575					J	Cao, X; Yin, JH; Wang, HJ; Zhao, JH; Zhang, J; Dai, LL; Zhang, JG; Jiang, H; Lin, ZM; Yang, Y				Cao, Xu; Yin, Jinghua; Wang, Huijun; Zhao, Jiahui; Zhang, Jie; Dai, Lanlan; Zhang, Jianguo; Jiang, Hui; Lin, Zhimiao; Yang, Yong			Mutation in AQP5, Encoding Aquaporin 5, Causes Palmoplantar Keratoderma Bothnia Type	JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATIVE DERMATOLOGY																Cao, Xu/G-6209-2015	Cao, Xu/0000-0003-1796-2735												0022-202X	1523-1747				JAN	2014	134	1					284	287		10.1038/jid.2013.302								WOS:000328594000044	23867895					J	Zi, J; Zhang, SY; Zhou, R; Zhou, BJ; Xu, SH; Hou, GX; Tan, FJ; Wen, B; Wang, QH; Lin, L; Liu, SQ				Zi, Jin; Zhang, Shenyan; Zhou, Ruo; Zhou, Baojin; Xu, Shaohang; Hou, Guixue; Tan, Fengji; Wen, Bo; Wang, Quanhui; Lin, Liang; Liu, Siqi			Expansion of the Ion Library for Mining SWATH-MS Data through Fractionation Proteomics	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												The strategy of sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra (SWATH) is emerging in the field of label-free proteomics. A critical consideration for the processing of SWATH data is the quality of the ion library (or mass spectrometric reference map). As the availability of open spectral libraries that can be used to process SWATH data is limited, most users currently create their libraries in-house. Herein, we propose an approach to construct an expanded ion library using the data-dependent acquisition (DDA) data generated by fractionation proteomics. We identified three critical elements for achieving a satisfactory ion library during the iterative process of our ion library expansion, including a correction of the retention times (RTs) gained from fractionation proteomics, appropriate integrations of the fractionated proteomics into an ion library, and assessments of the impact of the expanded ion libraries to data mining in SWATH. Using a bacterial lysate as an evaluation material, we employed sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) to fractionate the lysate proteins and constructed the expanded ion library using the fractionation proteomics data. Compared with the ion library built from the unfractionated proteomics, approximately 20% more peptides were extracted from the expanded ion library. The extracted peptides, moreover, were acceptable for further quantitative analysis.																	0003-2700	1520-6882				AUG 5	2014	86	15					7242	7246		10.1021/ac501828a								WOS:000340081100015	24969961					J	Jing, LP; Zhong, XM; Huang, WH; Liu, Y; Wang, M; Miao, ZL; Zhang, XP; Zou, J; Zheng, BW; Chen, CD; Liang, XM; Yang, G; Jing, CX; Wei, XC				Jing, Lipeng; Zhong, Xingming; Huang, Weihuang; Liu, Yang; Wang, Man; Miao, Zhulin; Zhang, Xiaoping; Zou, Jing; Zheng, Baowen; Chen, Congde; Liang, Xiaoman; Yang, Guang; Jing, Chunxia; Wei, Xiangcai			HPV genotypes and associated cervical cytological abnormalities in women from the Pearl River Delta region of Guangdong province, China: a cross-sectional study	BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES												Background: It is important to understand the specific HPV genotype distribution in screen-detected lesions. HPV Genotype is helpful for separating HPV-positive women at greater risk of cancer from those who can regress spontaneously and for preventing cervical cancer at early stage. The aim of this study was to investigate the high-risk HPV genotype distribution among cervical cytology abnormality in Pearl River Delta Region, Southern China Methods: 5585 HPV-infected women were screened from 77069 women in Pearl River Delta Region. Information was obtained from 3226 screened subjects through questionnaires and personal interviews. Exfoliated cervical cells were collected by doctors for HPV test with MassARRAY (Sequenom, Sandiego, CA) technique based on the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS). The ThinPrep cytology test was performed to screen for cervical cancer. Unconditional logistic was used to determine the most common HPV carcinogenic types. Results: Of the 3226 HPV-positive samples tested, 1744 (54.1%) with normal cervical cytology, 1482 (45.9%) with abnormal cytology. The five most common HPV types in this study were HPV16 (20.2%), HPV52 (17.1%), HPV58 (13.2%), HPV18 (9.5%), HPV6 (7.6%). Overall, HPV16 (OR = 10.5, 95% CI: 3.7 similar to 29.6), HPV33 (OR = 9.1, 95% CI: 2.8 similar to 29.2), HPV58 (OR = 6.3, 95% CI: 2.1 similar to 18.6), HPV31 (OR = 4.5, 95% CI: 1.3 similar to 15.5), multiple genotype infection (OR = 3.0, 95% CI: 1.7 similar to 14.7), especially HPV16 and HPV33, increased the risk of cytology abnormalities. Conclusions: HPV16, HPV31, HPV33, HPV58, and multiple HPV genotype infection increased the risk of cytology abnormalities in Pearl River Delta Region and might be useful for the screening, preventing, treating, and monitoring of pre-cancer lesions in southern China.																	1471-2334					JUL 12	2014	14								388	10.1186/1471-2334-14-388								WOS:000339523700001	25016305					J	Maia, VH; Gitzendanner, MA; Soltis, PS; Wong, GKS; Soltis, DE				Maia, Vitor H.; Gitzendanner, Matthew A.; Soltis, Pamela S.; Wong, Gane Ka-Shu; Soltis, Douglas E.			ANGIOSPERM PHYLOGENY BASED ON 18S/26S rDNA SEQUENCE DATA: CONSTRUCTING A LARGE DATA SET USING NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCE DATA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES												The utility of 18S and 26S in broad phylogenetic analyses has been much maligned due in large part to the low signal in both genes. However, few analyses have employed complete 26S rDNA sequences over a broad range of taxa, and most alignments of the two genes are done de novo, without taking into account the secondary structure of the two rRNA genes. Here we mine next-generation sequence data to compile large matrices (429 taxa) of complete 18S + 26S gene sequences, and we compare both de novo alignment methods with curated alignments done by eye that take into account secondary structure and hard-to-align regions (profile alignments). The combined 18S + 26S topology is overall very similar to recently published gene trees for the angiosperms based on three or more genes. Overall support for the backbone or framework of the combined tree is low (bootstrap support below 50%). Few major clades have bootstrap support above 50%. Most well-supported clades are tip clades (families and orders sensu APG III 2009). Importantly, the 18S + 26S rDNA topology is consistent with current estimates of relationships: the basalmost angiosperms are recovered (Amborellaceae, Nymphaeales, Austrobaileyales), as are most major clades, including Mesangiospermae, eudicots (Eudicotyledoneae sensu Cantino et al. 2007), core eudicots (Gunneridae sensu Cantino et al. 2007), rosids (Rosidae sensu Cantino et al. 2007), asterids (Asteridae sensu Cantino et al. 2007), and Caryophyllales. Most clades recognized at the ordinal level (sensu APG III 2009) are also recovered. However, there are also some unusual placements in the 18S + 26S topology, but none of these receives bootstrap support above 50%. The profile and de novo alignments gave very similar topologies. 18S + 26S trees remain useful sources of data in large combined analyses. This is the first time a large data set of complete 26S gene sequences has been employed at this scale; this gene in particular proved to be useful phylogenetically. Targeted sequencing of 18S/26S rDNA is not advocated here, but given that these regions provide useful phylogenetic information and are abundant in next-generation sequencing runs, we suggest that the data be used rather than discarded.

However, the molecular mechanisms of R. anatipestifer infection are poorly understood. In particular, the lack of genomic information from a variety of R. anatipestifer strains has proved severely limiting. Results: In this study, we present the complete genomes of two R. anatipestifer strains, RA-CH-1 (2,309,519 bp, Genbank accession CP003787) and RA-CH-2 (2,166,321 bp, Genbank accession CP004020). Both strains are from isolates taken from two different sick ducks in the SiChuang province of China. A comparative genomics approach was used to identify similarities and key differences between RA-CH-1 and RA-CH-2 and the previously sequenced strain RA-GD, a clinical isolate from GuangDong, China, and ATCC11845. Conclusion: The genomes of RA-CH-2 and RA-GD were extremely similar, while RA-CH-1 was significantly different than ATCC11845. RA-CH-1 is 140,000 bp larger than the three other strains and has 16 unique gene families. Evolutionary analysis shows that RA-CH-1 and RA-CH-2 are closed and in a branch with ATCC11845, while RA-GD is located in another branch. Additionally, the detection of several iron/heme-transport related proteins and motility mechanisms will be useful in elucidating factors important in pathogenicity. This information will allow a better understanding of the phenotype of different R. anatipestifer strains and molecular mechanisms of infection.

Nudivirus-like sequences were identified during the whole-genome sequencing of BPH. PCR examination showed that the virus sequences were present in all of the 22 BPH populations collected from East, Southeast, and South Asia. Thirty-two of the 33 nudivirus core genes were identified, including 20 homologues of baculovirus core genes. In addition, several gene clusters that were arranged collinearly with those of other nudiviruses were found in the partial virus genome. In a phylogenetic tree constructed using the supermatrix method, the original virus was grouped with other nudiviruses and was closely related to polydnavirus. Taken together, these data indicated that the virus sequences belong to a new member of the family Nudiviridae. More specifically, the virus sequences were integrated into the chromosome of its insect host during coevolution. This study is the first report of a large double-stranded circular DNA virus genome in a sap-sucking hemipteran insect.

Look AHEAD Res Grp; GIANT Consortium; CARe IBC Consortium	Gene-centric meta-analyses for central adiposity traits in up to 57 412 individuals of European descent confirm known loci and reveal several novel associations	HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS												Waist circumference (WC) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) are surrogate measures of central adiposity that are associated with adverse cardiovascular events, type 2 diabetes and cancer independent of body mass index (BMI). WC and WHR are highly heritable with multiple susceptibility loci identified to date. We assessed the association between SNPs and BMI-adjusted WC and WHR and unadjusted WC in up to 57 412 individuals of European descent from 22 cohorts collaborating with the NHLBIs Candidate Gene Association Resource (CARe) project. The study population consisted of women and men aged 2080 years. Study participants were genotyped using the ITMAT/Broad/CARE array, which includes 50 000 cosmopolitan tagged SNPs across 2100 cardiovascular-related genes. Each trait was modeled as a function of age, study site and principal components to control for population stratification, and we conducted a fixed-effects meta-analysis. No new loci for WC were observed. For WHR analyses, three novel loci were significantly associated (P 2.4 10(6)). Previously unreported rs2811337-G near TMCC1 was associated with increased WHR ( SE, 0.048 0.008, P 7.7 10(9)) as was rs7302703-G in HOXC10 ( 0.044 0.008, P 2.9 10(7)) and rs936108-C in PEMT ( 0.035 0.007, P 1.9 10(6)). Sex-stratified analyses revealed two additional novel signals among females only, rs12076073-A in SHC1 ( 0.10 0.02, P 1.9 10(6)) and rs1037575-A in ATBDB4 ( 0.046 0.01, P 2.2 10(6)), supporting an already established sexual dimorphism of central adiposity-related genetic variants. Functional analysis using ENCODE and eQTL databases revealed that several of these loci are in regulatory regions or regions with differential expression in adipose tissue.

Phylogenetic pinpointing of a paleopolyploidy event within the flax genus (Linum) using transcriptomics	ANNALS OF BOTANY												Cultivated flax (Linum usitatissimum) is known to have undergone a whole-genome duplication around 59 million years ago. The aim of this study was to investigate whether other whole-genome duplication events have occurred in the evolutionary history of cultivated flax. Knowledge of such whole-genome duplications will be important in understanding the biology and genomics of cultivated flax. Transcriptomes of 11 Linum species were sequenced using the Illumina platform. The short reads were assembled de novo and the DupPipe pipeline was used to look for signatures of polyploidy events from the age distribution of paralogues. In addition, phylogenies of all paralogues were assembled within an estimated age window of interest. These phylogenies were assessed for evidence of a paleopolyploidy event within the genus Linum. A previously unknown paleopolyploidy event that occurred 2040 million years ago was discovered and shown to be specific to a clade within Linum containing cultivated flax (L. usitatissimum) and other mainly blue-flowered species. The finding was supported by two lines of evidence. First, a significant change of slope (peak) was shown in the age distribution of paralogues that was phylogenetically restricted to, and ubiquitous in, this clade. Second, a large number of paralogue phylogenies were retrieved that are consistent with a polyploidy event occurring within that clade. The results show the utility of multi-species transcriptomics for detecting whole-genome duplication events and demonstrate that that multiple rounds of polyploidy have been important in shaping the evolutionary history of flax. Understanding and characterizing these whole-genome duplication events will be important for future Linum research.

The mutated messages have been found in the corresponding mRNAs; however, whether they could be translated to proteins still requires more evidence. Herein, we proposed a transomics strategy to profile the expression status of human Chr.20 genes (555 in Ensembl v72). The data of transcriptome and translatome (the mRNAs bound with ribosome, translating mRNAs) revealed that similar to 80% of the coding genes on Chr.20 were detected with mRNA signals in three liver cancer cell lines, whereas of the proteome identified, only similar to 45% of the Chr.20 coding genes were detected. The high amount of overlapping of identified genes in mRNA and RNC-mRNA (ribosome nascent-chain complex-bound mRNAs, translating mRNAs) and the consistent distribution of the abundance averages of mRNA and RNC-mRNA along the Chr.20 subregions in three liver cancer cell lines indicate that the mRNA information is efficiently transmitted from transcriptional to translational stage, qualitatively and quantitatively. Of the 457 genes identified in mRNAs and RNC-mRNA, 136 were found to contain SNVs with 213 sites, and >40% of these SNVs existed only in metastatic cell lines, suggesting them as the metastasis-related SNVs. Proteomics analysis showed that 16 genes with 20 SNV sites were detected with reliable MS/MS signals, and some SNVs were further validated by the MRM approach. With the integration of the omics data at the three expression phases, therefore, we are able to achieve the overall view of the gene expression of Chr.20, which is constructive in understanding the potential trend of encoding genes in a cell line and exploration of a new type of markers related to cancers.

Birds have evolved a female heterogametic sex system (male ZZ, female ZW), through stepwise suppression of recombination between chrZ and chrW. To address the broad patterns and complex driving forces of Z chromosome evolution, we analyze here 45 newly available bird genomes and four species' transcriptomes, over their course of recombination loss between the sex chromosomes. Results: We show Z chromosomes in general have a significantly higher substitution rate in introns and synonymous protein-coding sites than autosomes, driven by the male-to-female mutation bias ('male-driven evolution' effect). Our genome-wide estimate reveals that the degree of such a bias ranges from 1.6 to 3.8 among different species. G + C content of third codon positions exhibits the same trend of gradual changes with that of introns, between chrZ and autosomes or regions with increasing ages of becoming Z-linked, therefore codon usage bias in birds is probably driven by the mutational bias. On the other hand, Z chromosomes also evolve significantly faster at nonsynonymous sites relative to autosomes ('fast-Z' evolution). And species with a lower level of intronic heterozygosities tend to evolve even faster on the Z chromosome. Further analysis of fast-evolving genes' enriched functional categories and sex-biased expression patterns support that, fast-Z evolution in birds is mainly driven by genetic drift. Finally, we show in species except for chicken, gene expression becomes more male-biased within Z-linked regions that have became hemizygous in females for a longer time, suggesting a lack of global dosage compensation in birds, and the reported regional dosage compensation in chicken has only evolved very recently. Conclusions: In conclusion, we uncover that the sequence and expression patterns of Z chromosome genes covary with their ages of becoming Z-linked. In contrast to the mammalian X chromosomes, such patterns are mainly driven by mutational bias and genetic drift in birds, due to the opposite sex-biased inheritance of Z vs. X.

A live attenuated Y. pestis strain (EV76) has been widely used as a plague vaccine in various countries around the world. Here we compared the whole genome sequence of an EV76 strain used in China (EV76-CN) with the genomes of Y. pestis wild isolates to identify genetic variations specific to the EV76 lineage. We identified 6 SNPs and 6 Indels (insertions and deletions) differentiating EV76-CN from its counterparts. Then, we screened these polymorphic sites in 28 other strains of EV76 lineage that were stored in different countries. Based on the profiles of SNPs and Indels, we reconstructed the parsimonious dissemination history of EV76 lineage. This analysis revealed that there have been at least three independent imports of EV76 strains into China. Additionally, we observed that the pyrE gene is a mutation hotspot in EV76 lineages. The fine comparison results based on whole genome sequence in this study provide better understanding of the effects of laboratory passages on the accumulation of genetic polymorphisms in plague vaccine strains. These variations identified here will also be helpful in discriminating different EV76 derivatives. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Of these diseases, retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common and is genetically and clinically highly heterogeneous. At least 62 genes are associated with RP and mutations in these genes account for approximately half of the cases of disease. In the present study, mutations in the CHM gene, which are known to associate with choroideremia, were identified in six of 157 families with retinitis pigmentosa by whole exome sequencing. No potential pathogenic mutations in the 62 RP-associated genes were found in the six families. Sanger sequencing confirmed the, mutations in CHM, including four novel (c.558_559delTT, c.964G>T, c.966delA, c.1166+2T>G) and two known (c.703-1G>A and c.1584_1587delTGTT) mutations. Available clinical data suggest an atypical phenotype of choroideremia in these patients compared to that of Caucasians. Overlapping clinical features and atypical phenotypic variation may contribute to the confusion of one another. Awareness of the phenotypic variation and careful clinical examination may facilitate proper clinical diagnosis and genetic counseling of complicated hereditary retinal diseases. Whole exome sequencing therefore is useful in the identification of genetic cause for less clarified hereditary retinal diseases and enriches our understanding of phenotypic variations of gene mutation.																	1107-3756	1791-244X				AUG	2014	34	2					573	577		10.3892/ijmm.2014.1797								WOS:000339127900025	24913019					J	Pabon-Mora, N; Wong, GKS; Ambrose, BA				Pabon-Mora, Natalia; Wong, Gane Ka-Shu; Ambrose, Barbara A.			Evolution of fruit development genes in flowering plants	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												The genetic mechanisms regulating dry fruit development and opercular dehiscence have been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana. In the bicarpellate silique, valve elongation and differentiation is controlled by FRUITFULL (FUL) that antagonizes SHATTERPROOF1-2 (SHP1/SHP2) and INDEHISCENT (IND) at the dehiscence zone where they control normal lignification. SHP1/2 are also repressed by REPLUMLESS (RPL), responsible for replum formation. Similarly, FUL indirectly controls two other factors ALCATRAZ (ALC) and SPATULA (SPT) that function in the proper formation of the separation layer. FUL and SHP1/2 belong to the MADS-box family, IND and ALC belong to the bHLH family and RPL belongs to the homeodomain family, all of which are large transcription factor families. These families have undergone numerous duplications and losses in plants, likely accompanied by functional changes. Functional analyses of homologous genes suggest that this network is fairly conserved in Brassicaceae and less conserved in other core eudicots. Only the MADS box genes have been functionally characterized in basal eudicots and suggest partial conservation of the functions recorded for Brassicaceae. Here we do a comprehensive search of SHP, IND, ALC, SPT and RPL homologs across core-eudicots, basal eudicots, monocots and basal angiosperms. Based on gene-tree analyses we hypothesize what parts of the network for fruit development in Brassicaceae, in particular regarding direct and indirect targets of FUL, might be conserved across angiosperms.

The simultaneous detection of 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine is likely to stimulate the discovery of aberrantly methylated genes with increased accuracy in human hepatocellular carcinoma. Results: Here, we performed ultra-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry and single-base high-throughput sequencing, Hydroxymethylation and Methylation Sensitive Tag sequencing, HMST-seq, to synchronously measure these two modifications in human hepatocellular carcinoma samples. After identification of differentially methylated and hydroxymethylated genes in human hepatocellular carcinoma, we integrate DNA copy-number alterations, as determined using array-based comparative genomic hybridization data, with gene expression to identify genes that are potentially silenced by promoter hypermethylation. Conclusions: We report a high enrichment of genes with epigenetic aberrations in cancer signaling pathways. Six genes were selected as tumor suppressor gene candidates, among which, ECM1, ATF5 and EOMES are confirmed via siRNA experiments to have potential anti-cancer functions.																	1474-760X						2014	15	12							533	10.1186/s13059-014-0533-9								WOS:000346609500012	25517360					J	Zhang, X; Jia, HY; Lu, Y; Dong, CL; Hou, JH; Wang, Z; Wang, F; Zhong, HB; Wang, L; Wang, K				Zhang, Xu; Jia, Haiying; Lu, Yao; Dong, Chengliang; Hou, Jinghui; Wang, Zheng; Wang, Feng; Zhong, Hongbin; Wang, Lin; Wang, Kai			Exome Sequencing on Malignant Meningiomas Identified Mutations in Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) and Meningioma 1 (MN1) Genes	DISCOVERY MEDICINE												Background: Meningiomas are tumors originating from the membranous layers surrounding the central nervous system, and are generally regarded as "benign" tumors of the brain. Malignant meningiomas are rare and are typically associated with a higher risk of local tumor recurrence and a poorer prognosis (median survival time <2 years). Previous genome-wide association studies and exome sequencing studies have identified genes that play a role in susceptibility to meningiomas, but these studies did not focus specifically on malignant tumors. Methods: We performed exome sequencing on five malignant meningiomas on the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform using Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon kits. We used wANNOVAR web server to annotate and prioritize variants, identified candidate genes with recurrent mutations, and validated selected mutations by Sanger sequencing. We next designed custom NimbleGen targeted region arrays on five candidate genes, and sequenced four additional malignant meningiomas. Results: From exome sequencing data, we identified several frequently mutated genes including NF2, MN1, ARID1B, SEMA4D, and MUC2, with private mutations in tumors. We sequenced these genes in four additional samples and identified potential driver mutations in NF2 (neurofibromatosis type 2) and MN1 (meningioma 1). Conclusions: We confirmed that mutations in NF2 may play a role in progression of meningiomas, and nominated MN1 as a candidate gene for malignant transformation of meningiomas. Our sample size is limited by the extreme rarity of malignant meningiomas, but our study represents one of the first sequencing studies focusing on the malignant subtype.																	1539-6509	1944-7930				DEC	2014	18	101					301	311										WOS:000349316900002	25549701					J	Wen, B; Xu, SH; Sheynkman, GM; Feng, Q; Lin, L; Wang, QH; Xu, X; Wang, J; Liu, SQ				Wen, Bo; Xu, Shaohang; Sheynkman, Gloria M.; Feng, Qiang; Lin, Liang; Wang, Quanhui; Xu, Xun; Wang, Jun; Liu, Siqi			sapFinder: an R/Bioconductor package for detection of variant peptides in shotgun proteomics experiments	BIOINFORMATICS												Single nucleotide variations (SNVs) located within a reading frame can result in single amino acid polymorphisms (SAPs), leading to alteration of the corresponding amino acid sequence as well as function of a protein.

The novel information obtained herein revealed interesting patterns and provides an initial transcriptional insight into the thermophilic cellulose methanization process. Synergistic beta-sugar consumption by Thermotogales is crucial for cellulose hydrolysis in the thermophilic cellulose-degrading consortium because the primary cellulose degraders Clostridiales showed metabolic incompetence in subsequent beta-sugar pathways. Additionally, comparable transcription of putative Sus-like polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) was observed in an unclassified order of Bacteroidetes suggesting the importance of PULs mechanism for polysaccharides breakdown in thermophilic systems. Despite the abundance of acetate as a fermentation product, the acetate-utilizing Methanosarcinales were less prevalent by 60% than the hydrogenotrophic Methanobacteriales. Whereas the aceticlastic methanogenesis pathway was markedly more active in terms of transcriptional activities in key genes, indicating that the less dominant Methanosarcinales are more active than their hydrogenotrophic counterparts in methane metabolism. These findings suggest that the minority of aceticlastic methanogens are not necessarily associated with repressed metabolism, in a pattern that was commonly observed in the cellulose-based methanization consortium, and thus challenge the causal likelihood proposed by previous studies.

A total of 33,127 PAVs were detected and 28,912 PAV markers with their primer sequences were designed as the database NJAUSoyPAV_1.0. The PAVs scattered on whole genome while only 518 (1.8%) overlapped with simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in BARCSOYSSR_1.0 database. In a random sample of 800 PAVs, 713 (89.13%) showed polymorphism among the 12 differential genotypes. Using 126 PAVs and 108 SSRs to test a Chinese soybean germplasm collection composed of 828 Glycine soja Sieb. et Zucc. and Glycine max (L.) Merr. accessions, the per locus allele number and its variation appeared less in PAVs than in SSRs. The distinctness among alleles/bands of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) products showed better in PAVs than in SSRs, potential in accurate marker-assisted allele selection. The association mapping results showed SSR+PAV was more powerful than any single marker systems. The NJAUSoyPAV_1.0 database has enriched the source of PCR markers, and may fit the materials with a range of per locus allele numbers, if jointly used with SSR markers.																	1672-9072	1744-7909				OCT	2014	56	10					1009	1019		10.1111/jipb.12208								WOS:000342892400005	24751174					J	Pan, Q; Sun, BJ; Huang, XL; Jing, X; Liu, HL; Jiang, FM; Zhou, J; Lin, MM; Yue, HN; Hu, P; Ning, Y				Pan, Qiong; Sun, Baojuan; Huang, Xiaoli; Jing, Xin; Liu, Hailiang; Jiang, Fuman; Zhou, Jie; Lin, Mengmeng; Yue, Hongni; Hu, Ping; Ning, Ying			A prenatal case with discrepant findings between non-invasive prenatal testing and fetal genetic testings	MOLECULAR CYTOGENETICS												At 17(+4) week, non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) results of a 24-years-old mother showed high risk of monosomy X (45, X). Abnormally shaped head and cardiac defects were observed in prenatal ultrasound scan at 19(+3) week. Amniocentesis conducted at 19(+3) week identified karyotype 47, XX, +18, which suggested that the NIPT failed to detect trisomy 18 (T18) in this case. With a further massively parallel sequencing (MPS) of maternal blood, fetal and placental tissues, we found a confined placental mosaicism (CPM) with non-mosaic T18 fetus and multiclonal placenta with high prevalence of 45, X and low level of T18 cells. FISH and SNP-array evidence from the placental tissue confirmed genetic discrepancy between the fetus and placenta. Because the primary source of the fetal cell-free DNA that NIPT assesses is mostly originated from trophoblast cells, the level of T18 placental mosaicism may cause false negative NIPT result in this rare case of double aneuploidy.

For renal agenesis, the one-sided absence of renal tissue, the relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors to its pathogenesis are still unclear. In this study of a pair of monozygotic twins discordant for congenital renal agenesis, the genomic profile was analyzed from a set of blood samples using high-throughput exome-capture sequencing to detect single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), copy number variations (CNVs), and insertions and deletions (indels). Also, an epigenomic analysis used reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing to detect differentially methylated regions (DMRs). No discordant SNPs, CNVs, or indels were confirmed, but 514 DMRs were detected. KEGG analysis indicated the DMRs localized to 10 signaling pathways and 25 genes, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and 6 genes (FGF18, FGF12, PDGFRA, MAPK11, AMH, CTBP1) involved in organ development. Although methylation results from our adult patient and her sister may not represent the pattern that was present during kidney development, we could at least confirm a lack of obvious differences at the genome level, which suggests that nongenetic factors may be involved in the pathogenesis of renal agenesis.

Ducklings were fed with BSRPS and sBSRPS after challenged DHAV. Death was monitored, evaluation indexes of peroxidative and hepatic injury at the initial (4th and 8th hour) and later (54th hour) stages were detected. The results showed a fine treatment effect of BSRPS and sBSRPS. Visual hepatic pathological injury severities were less serious after the treatment At the initial stage, free radical levels in all groups were the same, and BSRPS and sBSRPS reduced the hepatic injury through inhibiting virus replication. At the later stage, mass free radicals were detected in VC group while free radical levels in BSRPS and sBSRPS groups were significantly lower than VC group. The antioxidant effect of BSRPS and sBSRPS might alleviate the hepatic injury. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we developed a novel computational approach to predict drug target groups that may reduce the number of candidate target proteins associated with a query drug. A benchmark dataset, consisting of 3028 drugs assigned within nine categories, was constructed by collecting data from KEGG. The nine categories are (1) G protein-coupled receptors, (2) cytokine receptors, (3) nuclear receptors, (4) ion channels, (5) transporters, (6) enzymes, (7) protein kinases, (8) cellular antigens and (9) pathogens. The proposed method combines the data gleaned from chemical-chemical similarities, chemical-chemical connections and chemical-protein connections to allocate drugs to each of the nine target groups. A jackknife test applied to the training dataset that was constructed from the benchmark dataset, provided an overall correct prediction rate of 87.45%, as compared to 87.79% for the test dataset that was constructed by randomly selecting 10% of samples from the benchmark dataset. These prediction rates are much higher than the 11.11% achieved by random guesswork. These promising results suggest that the proposed method can become a useful tool in identifying drug target groups.

However, the mechanisms underlying aberrant placentation remain unclear, especially during extraembryonic tissue development and early stages of placental formation. Using a mouse model, this investigation provides the first comparative proteomic analysis of in vivo (IVO) and in vitro-produced (IVP) extraembryonic tissues and placentas after IVO fertilization and development, or in vitro fertilization and culture, respectively. We identified 165 and 178 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between IVO and IVP extraembryonic tissues and placentas on Embryonic Day 7.5 (E7.5) and E10.5, respectively. Many DEPs were functionally associated with genetic information processing, such as impaired de novo DNA methylation, as well as posttranscriptional, translational and posttranslational dysregulation. These novel findings were further confirmed by global hypomethylation, and a lower level of correlation was found between the transcriptome and proteome in the IVP groups. In addition, numerous DEPs were involved in energy and amino acid metabolism, cytoskeleton organization and transport, and vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. These disturbed processes and pathways are likely to be associated with embryonic intrauterine growth restriction, an enlarged placenta, and impaired labyrinth morphogenesis. This study provides a direct and comprehensive reference for the further exploration of the placental mechanisms that underlie ART-induced developmental aberrations.

A homozygous mutation in a consanguineous family consolidates the role of ALDH1A3 in autosomal recessive microphthalmia	CLINICAL GENETICS												Anomalies of eye development can lead to the rare eye malformations microphthalmia and anophthalmia (small or absent ocular globes), which are genetically very heterogeneous. Several genes have been associated with microphthalmia and anophthalmia, and exome sequencing has contributed to the identification of new genes. Very recently, homozygous variations within ALDH1A3 have been associated with autosomal recessive microphthalmia with or without cysts or coloboma, and with variable subphenotypes of developmental delay/autism spectrum disorder in eight families. In a consanguineous family where three of the five siblings were affected with microphthalmia/coloboma, we identified a novel homozygous missense mutation in ALDH1A3 using exome sequencing. Of the three affected siblings, one had intellectual disability and one had intellectual disability and autism, while the last one presented with normal development. This study contributes further to the description of the clinical spectrum associated with ALDH1A3 mutations, and illustrates the interfamilial clinical variation observed in individuals with ALDH1A3 mutations.

However, the use of Sesamum indicum germplasm for breeding is limited by the lack of polymorphism data. Results: Here we describe the massively parallel resequencing of 29 sesame strains from 12 countries at a depth of >= 13-fold coverage for each of the samples tested. We detected an average of 127,347 SNPs, 17,961 small InDels, and 9,266 structural variants per sample. The population SNP rate, population diversity (pi) and Watterson's estimator of segregating sites (theta w) were estimated at 8.6 x 10(-3), 2.5 x 10(-3) and 3.0 x 10(-3) bp(-1), respectively. Of these SNPs, 23.2% were located within coding regions. Polymorphism patterns were nonrandom among gene families, with genes mediating interactions with the biotic or abiotic environment exhibiting high levels of polymorphism. The linkage disequilibrium (LD) decay distance was estimated at 150 kb, with no distinct structure observed in the population. Phylogenetic relationships between each of the 29 sesame strains were consistent with the hypothesis of sesame originating on the Indian subcontinent. In addition, we proposed novel roles for adenylate isopentenyltransferase (ITP) genes in determining the number of flowers per leaf axil of sesame by mediating zeatin biosynthesis. Conclusions: This study represents the first report of genome-wide patterns of genetic variation in sesame. The high LD distance and abundant polymorphisms described here increase our understanding of the forces shaping population-wide sequence variation in sesame and will be a valuable resource for future gene-phenotype and genome-wide association studies (GWAS).

Conditions for the validity of SNP-based heritability estimation	HUMAN GENETICS												The heritability of a trait (h (2)) is the proportion of its population variance caused by genetic differences, and estimates of this parameter are important for interpreting the results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In recent years, researchers have adopted a novel method for estimating a lower bound on heritability directly from GWAS data that uses realized genetic similarities between nominally unrelated individuals. The quantity estimated by this method is purported to be the contribution to heritability that could in principle be recovered from association studies employing the given panel of SNPs (). Thus far, the validity of this approach has mostly been tested empirically. Here, we provide a mathematical explication and show that the method should remain a robust means of obtaining under circumstances wider than those under which it has so far been derived.																	0340-6717	1432-1203				AUG	2014	133	8					1011	1022		10.1007/s00439-014-1441-5								WOS:000339809200006	24744256					J	Vattikuti, S; Lee, JJ; Chang, CC; Hsu, SDH; Chow, CC				Vattikuti, Shashaank; Lee, James J.; Chang, Christopher C.; Hsu, Stephen D.

Applying compressed sensing to genome-wide association studies	GIGASCIENCE												Background: The aim of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) is to isolate DNA markers for variants affecting phenotypes of interest. This is constrained by the fact that the number of markers often far exceeds the number of samples. Compressed sensing (CS) is a body of theory regarding signal recovery when the number of predictor variables (i.e., genotyped markers) exceeds the sample size. Its applicability to GWAS has not been investigated. Results: Using CS theory, we show that all markers with nonzero coefficients can be identified (selected) using an efficient algorithm, provided that they are sufficiently few in number (sparse) relative to sample size. For heritability equal to one (h(2) = 1), there is a sharp phase transition from poor performance to complete selection as the sample size is increased. For heritability below one, complete selection still occurs, but the transition is smoothed. We find for h(2) similar to 0.5 that a sample size of approximately thirty times the number of markers with nonzero coefficients is sufficient for full selection. This boundary is only weakly dependent on the number of genotyped markers. Conclusion: Practical measures of signal recovery are robust to linkage disequilibrium between a true causal variant and markers residing in the same genomic region. Given a limited sample size, it is possible to discover a phase transition by increasing the penalization; in this case a subset of the support may be recovered. Applying this approach to the GWAS analysis of height, we show that 70-100% of the selected markers are strongly correlated with height-associated markers identified by the GIANT Consortium.																		2047-217X				JUN 16	2014	3								10	10.1186/2047-217X-3-10								WOS:000365653700001	25002967					J	Yang, T; Meng, Y; Wei, XM; Shen, JD; Zhang, MR; Qi, C; Wang, CD; Liu, JY; Ma, MR; Huang, SZ				Yang, Tao; Meng, Yan; Wei, Xiaoming; Shen, Jiandong; Zhang, Mingrong; Qi, Chen; Wang, Chundan; Liu, Jiayin; Ma, Minrui; Huang, Shangzhi			Identification of novel mutations of PKD1 gene in Chinese patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease by targeted next-generation sequencing	CLINICA CHIMICA ACTA												Background: Mutations of PKD1 and PKD2 accounted for the most cases of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The presence of the large transcript, numerous exons and complex reiterated regions within the gene has significantly complicated the analysis of PKD1 with routine PCR-based approaches. Methods: We developed a strategy to analyze both the PKD1/PKD2 genes simultaneously using targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS). All coding exons plus the flanking sequences of PKD1 and PKD2 genes from probands were captured, individually barcoded and followed by HiSeq2000 sequencing. The candidate variants were validated by using classic Sanger sequencing. PKD1-specific primers were designed to amplify the replicated areas of PKD1 gene. Results: Five novel variations and one known mutation in PKD1 gene were detected in five familial and one sporadic Chinese ADPKD patients. Through pedigree and bioinformatic analysis, five of them were identified as pathogenic mutations (p.G1319R, p.Y3781*, p.W4122*, p.Val700Glyfs*14, and p.Leu3656Trpfs*28) and one was as polymorphism (p.T2420I). Conclusions: Our result showed that targeted capture and NGS technology were effective for the gene testing of ADPKD disorder. Mutation study of PKD1 and PKD2 genes in Chinese patients may contribute to better understanding of the genetic diversity between different ethnic groups and enrich the mutation database in Asian population.

More than thirty DFNB7/11 mutations have been reported, but only three DFNA36 mutations were reported previously. In this study, we found a large Chinese family with 222 family members showing post-lingual, progressive sensorineural hearing loss which were consistent with DFNA36 hearing loss. Auditory brainstem response (ABR) test of the youngest patient showed a special result with nearly normal threshold but prolonged latency, decreased amplitude, and the abnormal waveform morphology. Exome sequencing of the proband found four candidate variants in known hearing loss genes. Sanger sequencing in all family members found a novel variant c. 1253T> A (p. M418K) in TMC1 at DFNA36 that co-segregated with the phenotype. This mutation in TMC1 is orthologous to the mutation found in the hearing loss mouse model named Bth ten years ago. In another 51 Chinese autosomal dominant hearing loss families, we screened the segments containing the dominant mutations of TMC1 and no functional variants were found. TMC1 is expressed in the hair cells in inner ear. Given the already known roles of TMC1 in the mechanotransduction in the cochlea and its expression in inner ear, our results may provide an interesting perspective into its function in inner ear.

Methods: Whole-exome capturing and sequencing technology was used for the detection of genetic variations in 19 individuals from six families with high incidence of KBD. A total of 44 polymorphisms from 41 genes were genotyped from a total of 144 cases and 144 controls by using MassARRAY under the standard protocol from Sequenom. Association was applied on the data by using PLINK1.07. Results: In the sequencing stage, each sample showed approximately 70-fold coverage, thus covering more than 99% of the target regions. Among the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) used in the transmission disequilibrium test, 108 had a p-value of <0.01, whereas 1056 had a p-value of <0.05. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes(KEGG) pathway analysis indicates that these SNPs focus on three major pathways: regulation of actin cytoskeleton, focal adhesion, and metabolic pathways. In the validation stage, single locus effects revealed that two of these polymorphisms (rs7745040 and rs9275295) in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1 gene and one polymorphism (rs9473132) in CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) gene have a significant statistical association with KBD. Conclusions: HLA-DRB1 and CD2AP gene were identified to be among the susceptibility genes of KBD, thus supporting the role of the autoimmune response in KBD and the possibility of shared etiology between osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and KBD.				luo, hongrong/B-2714-2015; Li, Yingrui/K-1064-2015; Wang, Jun/C-8434-2016; Wang, Jun/B-9503-2016	luo, hongrong/0000-0001-7994-1193; Wang, Jun/0000-0002-8540-8931; Wang, Jun/0000-0002-2113-5874												1932-6203					APR 28	2014	9	4							e92298	10.1371/journal.pone.0092298								WOS:000346241800003	24776925					J	Liu, G; Wei, XM; Chen, R; Zhou, HL; Li, XY; Sun, Y; Xie, SQ; Zhu, Q; Qu, N; Yang, GH; Chu, YX; Wu, HT; Lan, ZZ; Wang, JM; Yang, Y; Yi, X				Liu, Gang; Wei, Xiaoming; Chen, Rui; Zhou, Hanlin; Li, Xiaoyan; Sun, Yan; Xie, Shuqi; Zhu, Qian; Qu, Ning; Yang, Guanghui; Chu, Yuxing; Wu, Haitao; Lan, Zhangzhang; Wang, Jinming; Yang, Yi; Yi, Xin			A novel mutation of the SLC25A13 gene in a Chinese patient with citrin deficiency detected by target next-generation sequencing	GENE												Type II citrullinaemia, also known as citrin deficiency, is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder, which is caused by pathogenic mutations in the SLC25A13 gene on chromosome 7q21.3. One of the clinical manifestations of type II citrullinaemia is neonatal intrahepatic cholestatic hepatitis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD, OMIM# 605814). In this study, a 5-month-old female Chinese neonate diagnosed with type II citrullinaemia was examined. The diagnosis was based on biochemical and clinical findings, including organic acid profiling using a gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS), and the patient's parents were unaffected. Approximately 14 kb of the exon sequences of the SLC25A13 and two relative genes (ASS1 and FAH) from the proband and 100 case-unrelated controls were captured by array-based capture method followed by high-throughput next-generation sequencing. Two single-nucleotide mutations were detected in the proband, including the previous reported c.1177+1G>A mutation and a novel c.754G>A mutation in the SLC25A13 gene. Sanger sequence results showed that the patient was a compound heterozygote for the two mutations. The novel mutation (c.754G>A), which is predicted to affect the normal structure and function of citrin, is a candidate pathogenic mutation. Target sequence capture combined with high-throughput next-generation sequencing technologies is proven to be an effective method for molecular genetic testing of type II citrullinaemia.

However, the relevant mechanisms remain unclear. To explore the effect of a space environment on Bacillus cereus, a strain of B. cereus was sent to space for 398 h by ShenZhou VIII from November 1, 2011 to November 17, 2011. A ground simulation with similar temperature conditions was simultaneously performed as a control. After the flight, the flight and control strains were further analyzed using phenotypic, genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic techniques to explore the divergence of B. cereus in a space environment. The flight strains exhibited a significantly slower growth rate, a significantly higher amikacin resistance level, and changes in metabolism relative to the ground control strain. After the space flight, three polymorphic loci were found in the flight strains LCT-BC25 and LCT-BC235. A combined transcriptome and proteome analysis was performed, and this analysis revealed that the flight strains had changes in genes/proteins relevant to metabolism. In addition, certain genes/proteins that are relevant to structural function, gene expression modification and translation, and virulence were also altered. Our study represents the first documented analysis of the phenotypic, genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic changes that occur in B. cereus during space flight, and our results could be beneficial to the field of space microbiology.

Moving toward species-level phylogeny using ribosomal DNA and COI barcodes: an example from the diverse caddisfly genus Chimarra (Trichoptera: Philopotamidae)	Arthropod Systematics & Phylogeny												The genus Chimarra (Trichoptera, Philopotamidae) is a cosmopolitan genus with over 700 species. The taxonomic history of Chimarra is discussed, with reference to how large genera are best subdivided. We also examine the phylogenetic utility of the COI "barcode" fragment and find it to be phylogenetically useful, within limits. Adding a single fragment of nuclear rRNA (specifically the 28S D2 region) converts the barcode hypothesis into a strongly supported phylogeny that is corroborated by a morphologically derived subgeneric classification. This suggests that a simple two gene dataset could be combined with morphological data in order to rapidly and inexpensively include a molecular component to generic revisions. We confirm the monophyly of Chimarra (Chimarra), C. (Curgia), C. (Otarrha), and core C. (Chimarrita). The C. (C.) tsudai group is also recovered. We make use of web-based materials, including the BOLD website (http://www.boldsystems.org/), and keyhole markup language files (.kml format), which permit specimen data to be viewed on Google Earth. We suggest that static phylogenies presented in print could be dynamically updated with the use of these web materials.

Cataract-microcornea syndrome (CCMC) is an autosomal dominant inherited disease characterized by the association of congenital cataract and microcornea without any other systemic anomaly or dysmorphism. Although mutations of several genes have been shown to cause dominant CCMC, in many patients the causative gene has not yet been identified. Our aim was to identify the disease-associated gene in Chinese patients with CCMC. METHODS. The CCMC patients from two unrelated Chinese families and 26 sporadic patients were enrolled. All the patients were screened by Sanger sequencing with no identified mutations. Genetic variations were screened by whole-exome sequencing and then validated using Sanger sequencing. RESULTS. By sequencing the whole exome of three patients in a Chinese four-generation dominant CCMC family (Family A), three heterozygous missense mutation (c.115C>G, c.277G>A, and c.4393G>A) were identified in ATP-binding cassette protein A3 (ABCA3). At highly conserved positions, changes (c.115C>G and c.4393G>A) were predicted to have functional impacts and completely cosegregated with the phenotype. We further confirmed our finding by identifying another heterozygous missense mutation, c.2408C>T, in ABCA3 in an additional dominant CCMC family (Family B), which also cosegregated with the phenotype. Moreover, four heterozygous mutations, two missense mutations (c.4253A>T, c.2069A>T) and two splice site mutations (c.4053_2T>C, c.2765-1G>T) were identified from the sporadic patients. The ABCA3 protein was expressed in human lens capsule, choroid-retinal pigment epithelium and retinal pigment epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS. Mutations in the human ABCA3 gene were associated with lethal respiratory distress. Our study showed, for the first time to our knowledge, that mutations in ABCA3 were associated with CCMC, warranting further investigations on the pathogenesis of this disorder.																	0146-0404	1552-5783				DEC	2014	55	12					8031	8043		10.1167/iovs.14-14098								WOS:000347222300036	25406294					J	Zhou, QY; Pan, L; Chen, SC; Chen, F; Hwang, R; Yang, XN; Wang, W; Jiang, JY; Xu, J; Huang, HF; Xu, CM				Zhou, Qiyin; Pan, Ling; Chen, Songchang; Chen, Fang; Hwang, Rosa; Yang, Xiaonan; Wang, Wei; Jiang, Jingyi; Xu, Jian; Huang, Hefeng; Xu, Chenming			Clinical application of noninvasive prenatal testing for the detection of trisomies 21, 18, and 13: a hospital experience	PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS												ObjectiveThe aim of this study is to report the clinical application of noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) to detect chromosomal aneuploidies, especially trisomies 21, 18, and 13 in Chinese singleton pregnancies. MethodsPilot validation between NIPT with full karyotyping was conducted blindly on 306 cases. Subsequently, 7705 pregnancies were offered with NIPT. Follow-up data was obtained in all cases. ResultsIn the validation stage, a total of five NIPT positive cases were observed for trisomies 21 and 18, and results were confirmed by karyotyping; there were no cases of trisomy 13. Thus, the overall sensitivity and specificity in the validation stage was 100%. In 7705 cases, NIPT results were obtained in 7701 cases; 66 cases were classified as positive, including 48 cases of trisomy 21, 14 cases of trisomy 18, and 4 cases of trisomy 13. Subsequent karyotyping documented two false positive diagnoses for trisomies 21, 18, and 13, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity for detection of trisomies 21 and 18 and 13 were 100% and 99.9%, respectively. Additionally, prenatal chromosomal detection for pregnancies with NIPT has shown a gradual increase since its implementation. ConclusionNoninvasive prenatal testing allows a more suitable and efficient workflow for our patients' needs, together with invasive procedures allows a higher prenatal detection of chromosomal aneuploidies.

Attempts to address this problem are hindered by the complexity of controlling cell fate commitment and the lack of sufficient developmental knowledge for guiding hPSC differentiation. Here, we developed a systematic strategy to study hPSC differentiation by labeling sequential developmental genes to encompass the major developmental stages, using the directed differentiation of pancreatic beta cells from hPSCs as a model. We therefore generated a large panel of pancreas-specific mono-and dual-reporter cell lines. With this unique platform, we visualized the kinetics of the entire differentiation process in real time for the first time by monitoring the expression dynamics of the reporter genes, identified desired cell populations at each differentiation stage and demonstrated the ability to isolate these cell populations for further characterization. We further revealed the expression profiles of isolated NGN3-eGFP(+) cells by RNA sequencing and identified sushi domain-containing 2 (SUSD2) as a novel surface protein that enriches for pancreatic endocrine progenitors and early endocrine cells both in human embryonic stem cells (hESC)-derived pancreatic cells and in the developing human pancreas. Moreover, we captured a series of cell fate transition events in real time, identified multiple cell subpopulations and unveiled their distinct gene expression profiles, among heterogeneous progenitors for the first time using our dual reporter hESC lines. The exploration of this platform and our new findings will pave the way to obtain mature beta cells in vitro.					liu, Haisong/0000-0002-7645-0855												1001-0602	1748-7838				OCT	2014	24	10					1181	1200		10.1038/cr.2014.118								WOS:000344993300008	25190258					J	Xiong, W; Chen, Y; Wang, Y; Liu, JG				Xiong, Wen; Chen, Yun; Wang, Yu; Liu, Jiaguo			Roles of the antioxidant properties of icariin and its phosphorylated derivative in the protection against duck virus hepatitis	BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH												Background: Duck viral hepatitis (DVH) is an acute disease of young ducklings with few convenient and effective veterinary drugs to treat. In pathology, present study mainly focused on the immune mechanism, but very few studies have concerned with the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of DVH. To study the antioxidative and hepatoprotective effects of icariin and its phosphorylated derivative against DVH, we prepared phosphorylated icariin (p-icariin) using the sodium trimetaphosphate-sodium tripolyphosphate method. Ducklings were drunk with icariin and p-icariin after being challenged with duck hepatitis virus 1 (DHV-1). We recorded the number of dead ducklings, gross pathological changes in the liver, and changes in indices of oxidative stress and liver injury. The correlations between these indices were also analyzed. Results: Exposure to DHV-1 induced significant oxidative damage in ducklings. Administration of icariin or p-icariin attenuated liver pathological injury and significantly increased the survival rate, with better outcomes in ducklings treated with p-icariin than in those treated with icariin. Icariin and p-icariin also attenuated the changes in oxidative stress and liver injury. We found positive correlations among indices of oxidative stress (malondialdehyde and inducible nitric oxide synthase) and liver injury (alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase), suggesting that DHV-1 causes significant oxidative damage, which is related to the extent of hepatic injury. Conclusions: Icariin and p-icariin improved the survival and attenuated oxidative stress and liver dysfunction induced by DHV-1. These outcomes were better in ducklings treated with p-icariin than in those treated by icariin. The clinical effects of both components were related to their antioxidant activities.																	1746-6148					SEP 24	2014	10								226	10.1186/s12917-014-0226-3								WOS:000346804500001	25244948					J	You, YQ; Sun, Y; Li, XC; Li, YL; Wei, XM; Chen, F; Ge, HJ; Lan, ZZ; Zhu, Q; Tang, Y; Wang, SJ; Gao, Y; Jiang, FM; Song, JP; Shi, Q; Zhu, X; Mu, F; Dong, W; Gao, VC; Jiang, H; Yi, X; Wang, W; Gao, ZY				You, Yanqin; Sun, Yan; Li, Xuchao; Li, Yali; Wei, Xiaoming; Chen, Fang; Ge, Huijuan; Lan, Zhangzhang; Zhu, Qian; Tang, Ying; Wang, Shujuan; Gao, Ya; Jiang, Fuman; Song, Jiaping; Shi, Quan; Zhu, Xuan; Mu, Feng; Dong, Wei; Gao, Vince; Jiang, Hui; Yi, Xin; Wang, Wei; Gao, Zhiying			Integration of targeted sequencing and NIPT into clinical practice in a Chinese family with maple syrup urine disease	GENETICS IN MEDICINE												Purpose: This article demonstrates a prominent noninvasive prenatal approach to assist the clinical diagnosis of a single-gene disorder disease, maple syrup urine disease, using targeted sequencing knowledge from the affected family. Methods: The method reported here combines novel mutant discovery in known genes by targeted massively parallel sequencing With noninvasive prenatal testing. Results: By applying this new strategy, we successfully revealed, novel mutations in the gene BCKDHA (Ex2_4dup and c.392A>G) in this Chinese family and developed a prenatal haplotype-assisted approach to noninvasively detect the genotype of the fetus (transmitted from both parents). Conclusion: This is the first report of integration of targeted sequencing and noninvasive prenatal testing into clinical practice. Our study has demonstrated that this massively parallel sequencing-based strategy can potentially be used for single-gene disorder diagnosis in the future.					lan, zhangzhang/0000-0001-5237-8150; Gao, Ya/0000-0002-5094-9842												1098-3600	1530-0366				AUG	2014	16	8					594	600		10.1038/gim.2013.197								WOS:000340024500005	24603436					J	Wang, HJ; Tang, ZL; Lin, ZM; Dai, LL; Chen, Q; Yang, Y				Wang, H.

Recurrent splice-site mutation in MBTPS2 underlying IFAP syndrome with Olmsted syndrome-like features in a Chinese patient	CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL DERMATOLOGY												Mutations inMBTPS2 have been reported to cause a broad phenotypic spectrum of X-linked genodermatoses, including IFAP (ichthyosis follicularis; atrichia and photophobia) syndrome (OMIM 308205) with or withoutBRESHECK (brain anomalies, retardation of mentality and growth, ectodermal dysplasia, skeletal malformations, Hirschsprung disease, ear deformity and deafness, eye hypoplasia, cleft palate, cryptorchidism, and kidney dysplasia/hypoplasia) syndrome, keratosis follicularis spinulosa decalvans (KFSD; OMIM 308800) and an X-linked form of Olmsted syndrome. We report a recurrent intronic mutation in MBTPS2(c.671-9T>G) in a Chinese patient with the typical triad of IFAP syndrome (i.e. ichthyosis, atrichia and photophobia), along with pachyonychia, palmoplantar and periorificial keratoderma, which were reminiscent of Olmsted syndrome. Interestingly, this mutation was previously reported in two cases of IFAP without keratoderma, which suggests clinical heterogeneicity of the same mutation in MBTPS2. The concomitance of Olmsted syndrome-like features in this patient with IFAP may challenge the existence of the X-linked form of Olmsted syndrome as an independent condition.																	0307-6938	1365-2230				MAR	2014	39	2					158	161		10.1111/ced.12248								WOS:000331183400009	24313295					J	Li, XC; Chen, SP; Xie, WW; Vogel, I; Choy, KW; Chen, F; Christensen, R; Zhang, CL; Ge, HJ; Jiang, HJ; Yu, C; Huang, F; Wang, W; Jiang, H; Zhang, XQ				Li, Xuchao; Chen, Shengpei; Xie, Weiwei; Vogel, Ida; Choy, Kwong Wai; Chen, Fang; Christensen, Rikke; Zhang, Chunlei; Ge, Huijuan; Jiang, Haojun; Yu, Chang; Huang, Fang; Wang, Wei; Jiang, Hui; Zhang, Xiuqing			PSCC: Sensitive and Reliable Population-Scale Copy Number Variation Detection Method Based on Low Coverage Sequencing	PLOS ONE												Background: Copy number variations (CNVs) represent an important type of genetic variation that deeply impact phenotypic polymorphisms and human diseases. The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies provides an opportunity to revolutionize the discovery of CNVs and to explore their relationship with diseases. However, most of the existing methods depend on sequencing depth and show instability with low sequence coverage. In this study, using low coverage whole-genome sequencing (LCS) we have developed an effective population-scale CNV calling (PSCC) method. Methodology/Principal Findings: In our novel method, two-step correction was used to remove biases caused by local GC content and complex genomic characteristics. We chose a binary segmentation method to locate CNV segments and designed combined statistics tests to ensure the stable performance of the false positive control. The simulation data showed that our PSCC method could achieve 99.7%/100% and 98.6%/100% sensitivity and specificity for over 300 kb CNV calling in the condition of LCS (similar to 2x) and ultra LCS (similar to 0.2x), respectively. Finally, we applied this novel method to analyze 34 clinical samples with an average of 2xLCS. In the final results, all the 31 pathogenic CNVs identified by aCGH were successfully detected. In addition, the performance comparison revealed that our method had significant advantages over existing methods using ultra LCS. Conclusions/Significance: Our study showed that PSCC can sensitively and reliably detect CNVs using low coverage or even ultra-low coverage data through population-scale sequencing.																	1932-6203					JAN 21	2014	9	1							e85096	10.1371/journal.pone.0085096								WOS:000330244500035	24465483					J	Liu, Y; Ying, WT; Ren, Z; Gu, W; Zhang, Y; Yan, GQ; Yang, PY; Liu, YK; Yin, XF; Chang, C; Jiang, J; Fan, FX; Zhang, CP; Xu, P; Wang, QH; Wen, B; Lin, L; Wang, TY; Du, CQ; Zhong, JY; Wang, T; He, QY; Qian, XH; Lou, XM; Zhang, G; Zhong, F				Liu, Yang; Ying, Wantao; Ren, Zhe; Gu, Wei; Zhang, Yang; Yan, Guoquan; Yang, Pengyuan; Liu, Yinkun; Yin, Xuefei; Chang, Cheng; Jiang, Jing; Fan, Fengxu; Zhang, Chengpu; Xu, Ping; Wang, Quanhui; Wen, Bo; Lin, Liang; Wang, Tingyou; Du, Chaoqin; Zhong, Jiayong; Wang, Tong; He, Qing-Yu; Qian, Xiaohong; Lou, Xiaomin; Zhang, Gong; Zhong, Fan			Chromosome-8-Coded Proteome of Chinese Chromosome Proteome Data Set (CCPD) 2.0 with Partial Immunohistochemical Verifications	JOURNAL OF PROTEOME RESEARCH												We upgraded the preliminary CCPD 1.0 to CCPD 2.0 using the latest deep-profiling proteome (CCPD 2013) of three hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines, namely, Hep3B, MHCC97H, and HCCLM3 (ProteomeXchange identifiers: PXD000529, PXD000533, and PXD000535). CCPD 2.0 totally covered 63.6% (438/689) of Chr. 8-coded proteins and 62.6% (439/701) of Chr. 8-coded. protein-coding genes. Interestingly, we found that the missing proteins exhibited a tendency to form a cluster region in chromosomes, such as two beta-defensins clusters in Chr. 8, caused perhaps by their inflammation-related features. For the 41 Chr. 8-coded proteins being weakly or barely identified previously, we have performed an immunohistochemical (IHC) verification in 30 pairs of carcinoma/para-carcinoma HCC and 20 noncancerous liver tissues and confirmed their expressional evidence and occurrence proportions in tissue samples. We also verified 13 Chr. 8-coded HCC tumorigenesis-associated depleting or deficient proteins reported in CCPD 1.0 using IHC and screened 16 positive and 24 negative HCC metastatic potential-correlated proteins from large-scale label-free proteome quantitation data of CCPD 2013. Our results suggest that the selection of proper samples and the methodology to look for targeted missing proteins should be carefully considered in further verifications for the remaining Chr. 8-coded. proteins.

PLOS ONE												Background: Ziziphus Mill. (jujube), the most valued genus of Rhamnaceae, comprises of a number of economically and ecologically important species such as Z. jujuba Mill., Z. acidojujuba Cheng et Liu and Z. mauritiana Lam. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and a high-density genetic map are of great benefit to the improvement of the crop, mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) and analyzing genome structure. However, such a high-density map is still absent in the genus Ziziphus and even the family Rhamnaceae. The recently developed restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) marker has been proven to be most powerful in genetic map construction. The objective of this study was to construct a high-density linkage map using the RAD tags generated by next generation sequencing. Results: An interspecific F1 population and their parents (Z. jujuba Mill. 'JMS2' x Z. acidojujuba Cheng et Liu 'Xing 16') were genotyped using a mapping-by-sequencing approach, to generate RAD-based SNP markers. A total of 42,784 putative high quality SNPs were identified between the parents and 2,872 high-quality RAD markers were grouped in genetic maps. Of the 2,872 RAD markers, 1,307 were linked to the female genetic map, 1,336 to the male map, and 2,748 to the integrated map spanning 913.87 centi-morgans (cM) with an average marker interval of 0.34 cM. The integrated map contained 12 linkage groups (LGs), consistent with the haploid chromosome number of the two parents. Conclusion: We first generated a high-density genetic linkage map with 2,748 RAD markers for jujube and a large number of SNPs were also developed. It provides a useful tool for both marker-assisted breeding and a variety of genome investigations in jujube, such as sequence assembly, gene localization, QTL detection and genome structure comparison.																	1932-6203					OCT 10	2014	9	10							e109850	10.1371/journal.pone.0109850								WOS:000343730400086	25303289					J	Xu, F; Wang, XT; Feng, Y; Huang, W; Wang, W; Li, L; Fang, XD; Que, HY; Zhang, GF				Xu, Fei; Wang, Xiaotong; Feng, Yue; Huang, Wen; Wang, Wei; Li, Li; Fang, Xiaodong; Que, Huayong; Zhang, Guofan			Identification of Conserved and Novel MicroRNAs in the Pacific Oyster Crassostrea gigas by Deep Sequencing	PLOS ONE												MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in regulatory processes in various organisms. To date many studies have been performed in the investigation of miRNAs of numerous bilaterians, but limited numbers of miRNAs have been identified in the few species belonging to the clade Lophotrochozoa. In the current study, deep sequencing was conducted to identify the miRNAs of Crassostrea gigas (Lophotrochozoa) at a genomic scale, using 21 libraries that included different developmental stages and adult organs. A total of 100 hairpin precursor loci were predicted to encode miRNAs. Of these, 19 precursors (pre-miRNA) were novel in the oyster. As many as 53 (53%) miRNAs were distributed in clusters and 49 (49%) precursors were intragenic, which suggests two important biogenetic sources of miRNAs. Different developmental stages were characterized with specific miRNA expression patterns that highlighted regulatory variation along a temporal axis. Conserved miRNAs were expressed universally throughout different stages and organs, whereas novel miRNAs tended to be more specific and may be related to the determination of the novel body plan. Furthermore, we developed an index named the miRNA profile age index (miRPAI) to integrate the evolutionary age and expression levels of miRNAs during a particular developmental stage. We found that the swimming stages were characterized by the youngest miRPAIs. Indeed, the large-scale expression of novel miRNAs indicated the importance of these stages during development, particularly from organogenetic and evolutionary perspectives. Some potentially important miRNAs were identified for further study through significant changes between expression patterns in different developmental events, such as metamorphosis. This study broadened the knowledge of miRNAs in animals and indicated the presence of sophisticated miRNA regulatory networks related to the biological processes in lophotrochozoans.																	1932-6203					AUG 19	2014	9	8							e104371	10.1371/journal.pone.0104371								WOS:000340742100031	25137038					J	Hong, N; Chen, YH; Xie, C; Xu, BS; Huang, H; Li, X; Yang, YQ; Huang, YP; Deng, JL; Qi, M; Gu, YS				Hong, Nan; Chen, Yan-hua; Xie, Chen; Xu, Bai-sheng; Huang, Hui; Li, Xin; Yang, Yue-qing; Huang, Ying-ping; Deng, Jian-lian; Qi, Ming; Gu, Yang-shun			Identification of a novel mutation in a Chinese family with Nance-Horan syndrome by whole exome sequencing	JOURNAL OF ZHEJIANG UNIVERSITY-SCIENCE B												Nance-Horan syndrome (NHS) is a rare X-linked disorder characterized by congenital nuclear cataracts, dental anomalies, and craniofacial dysmorphisms. Mental retardation was present in about 30% of the reported cases. The purpose of this study was to investigate the genetic and clinical features of NHS in a Chinese family. Whole exome sequencing analysis was performed on DNA from an affected male to scan for candidate mutations on the X-chromosome. Sanger sequencing was used to verify these candidate mutations in the whole family. Clinical and ophthalmological examinations were performed on all members of the family. A combination of exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing revealed a nonsense mutation c.322G > T (E108X) in exon 1 of NHS gene, co-segregating with the disease in the family. The nonsense mutation led to the conversion of glutamic acid to a stop codon (E108X), resulting in truncation of the NHS protein. Multiple sequence alignments showed that codon 108, where the mutation (c.322G > T) occurred, was located within a phylogenetically conserved region. The clinical features in all affected males and female carriers are described in detail. We report a nonsense mutation c.322G > T (E108X) in a Chinese family with NHS. Our findings broaden the spectrum of NHS mutations and provide molecular insight into future NHS clinical genetic diagnosis.

Vector control is one of the most effective measures to prevent malaria transmission. However, there is little transcriptome information available for the malaria vector. To better understand the biological basis of malaria transmission and to develop novel and effective means of vector control, there is a need to build a transcriptome dataset for functional genomics analysis by large-scale RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Methods: To provide a more comprehensive and complete transcriptome of An. sinensis, eggs, larvae, pupae, male adults and female adults RNA were pooled together for cDNA preparation, sequenced using the Illumina paired-end sequencing technology and assembled into unigenes. These unigenes were then analyzed in their genome mapping, functional annotation, homology, codon usage bias and simple sequence repeats (SSRs). Results: Approximately 51.6 million clean reads were obtained, trimmed, and assembled into 38,504 unigenes with an average length of 571 bp, an N50 of 711 bp, and an average GC content 51.26%. Among them, 98.4% of unigenes could be mapped onto the reference genome, and 69% of unigenes could be annotated with known biological functions. Homology analysis identified certain numbers of An. sinensis unigenes that showed homology or being putative 1: 1 orthologues with genomes of other Dipteran species. Codon usage bias was analyzed and 1,904 SSRs were detected, which will provide effective molecular markers for the population genetics of this species. Conclusions: Our data and analysis provide the most comprehensive transcriptomic resource and characteristics currently available for An. sinensis, and will facilitate genetic, genomic studies, and further vector control of An. sinensis.

We aimed to identify susceptibility loci for IS by exome sequencing in a Chinese Han population. Exome sequencing was used to screen susceptibility loci among 100 cases and 100 matched controls. Significant SNPs from the first stage were verified in up to 3,554 participants from three hospital-based case-control studies. In the initial exome sequencing analysis, rs10489177 in c1orf156 gene located on chromosome 1q24 (p < 1 x 10(-8)) and rs17118 in XYLB gene located on chromosome 3p21 (p < 1 x 10(-6)) were found to be significantly associated with IS. In the following validation stage, significantly increased odds ratios were observed in individuals with rs10489177 GG (OR = 2.02, 95 % CI = 1.35-3.03) or rs17118 AA genotype (OR = 1.50, 95 % CI = 1.17-1.91). The rs10489177 GG genotype was associated with significantly increased risk for IS in individuals without hypertension (OR = 2.78, 95 % CI = 1.59-4.86) and in individuals without diabetes (OR = 1.93, 95 % CI = 1.27-2.94). In contrast, the rs17118 AA genotype may significantly increase the risk for IS, particularly for individuals with hypertension (OR = 1.73, 95 % CI = 1.08-2.78) and for individuals without diabetes (OR = 1.52, 95 % CI = 1.17-1.98) or non-smoker (OR = 1.59, 95 % CI = 1.16-2.19). Collectively, our study identified two novel loci (rs17118 and rs10489177) which were associated with an increased risk for IS in Chinese Han populations. Further studies are needed to confirm these associations in other populations and elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying the observed associations.																	0893-7648	1559-1182				APR	2014	49	2					852	862		10.1007/s12035-013-8561-0								WOS:000332953400019	24122314					J	Guo, M; Zhou, Q; Zhou, YZ; Yang, LF; Liu, TX; Yang, JL; Chen, YL; Su, LX; Xu, J; Chen, J; Liu, F; Chen, JP; Dai, WK; Ni, PX; Fang, CX; Yang, RF				Guo, Min; Zhou, Qian; Zhou, Yizhuang; Yang, Linfeng; Liu, Tianxiang; Yang, Jinlong; Chen, Yanling; Su, Longxiang; Xu, Jin; Chen, Jing; Liu, Feng; Chen, Jiapeng; Dai, Wenkui; Ni, Peixiang; Fang, Chengxiang; Yang, Ruifu			Genomic Evolution of 11 Type Strains within Family Planctomycetaceae	PLOS ONE												The species in family Planctomycetaceae are ideal groups for investigating the origin of eukaryotes. Their cells are divided by a lipidic intracytoplasmic membrane and they share a number of eukaryote-like molecular characteristics. However, their genomic structures, potential abilities, and evolutionary status are still unknown. In this study, we searched for common protein families and a core genome/pan genome based on 11 sequenced species in family Planctomycetaceae. Then, we constructed phylogenetic tree based on their 832 common protein families. We also annotated the 11 genomes using the Clusters of Orthologous Groups database. Moreover, we predicted and reconstructed their core/pan metabolic pathways using the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) orthology system. Subsequently, we identified genomic islands (GIs) and structural variations (SVs) among the five complete genomes and we specifically investigated the integration of two Planctomycetaceae plasmids in all 11 genomes.

We applied whole exome sequencing to a three-generation family with optic atrophy followed by retinitis pigmentosa (RP) in all three cases, and ataxia, progressive peripheral neuropathy and hearing loss with variable presentation. Methods: Whole exome sequencing was performed in two affecteds and one unaffected member of the family. Sanger sequencing was used to validate and segregate the 12 candidate mutations in the family and to confirm the absence of the novel variant in PRPS1 in 191 controls. The pathogenic role of the novel mutation in PRPS1 was assessed in silico and confirmed by enzymatic determination of PRS activity, mRNA expression and sequencing, and X-chromosome inactivation. Results: A novel missense mutation was identified in PRPS1 in the affected females. Age of onset, presentation and severity of the phenotype are highly variable in the family: both the proband and her mother have neurological and ophthalmological symptoms, whereas the phenotype of the affected sister is milder and currently confined to the eye. Moreover, only the proband displayed a complete lack of expression of the wild type allele in leukocytes that seems to correlate with the degree of PRS deficiency and the severity of the phenotype. Interestingly, optic atrophy and RP are the only common manifestations to all three females and the only phenotype correlating with the degree of enzyme deficiency. Conclusions: These results are in line with recent evidence of the existence of intermediate phenotypes in PRS-I deficiency syndromes and demonstrate that females can exhibit a disease phenotype as severe and complex as their male counterparts.

Boesenbergia rotunda is a plant from the Zingiberaceae family commonly used as a food ingredient and traditional medicine in Southeast Asia and China. Reports on the health benefits of secondary metabolites extracted from Boesenbergia rotunda over the last few years has resulted in rising demands for panduratin A. However large scale extraction has been hindered by the naturally low abundance of the compound and limited knowledge of its biosynthetic pathway. Results: Transcriptome sequencing and digital gene expression (DGE) analysis of native and phenylalanine treated Boesenbergia rotunda cell suspension cultures were carried out to elucidate the key genes differentially expressed in the panduratin A biosynthetic pathway. Based on experiments that show increase in panduratin A production after 14 days post treatment with exogenous phenylalanine, an aromatic amino acid derived from the shikimic acid pathway, total RNA of untreated and 14 days post-phenylalanine treated cell suspension cultures were extracted and sequenced using next generation sequencing technology employing an Illumina-Solexa platform. The transcriptome data generated 101, 043 unigenes with 50, 932 (50.41%) successfully annotated in the public protein databases; including 49.93% (50, 447) in the non-redundant (NR) database, 34.63% (34, 989) in Swiss-Prot, 24,07% (24, 316) in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and 16.26% (16, 426) in Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG). Through DGE analysis, we found that 14, 644 unigenes were up-regulated and 14, 379 unigenes down-regulated in response to exogenous phenylalanine treatment. In the phenylpropanoid pathway leading to the proposed panduratin A production, 2 up-regulated phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), 3 up-regulated 4-coumaroyl: coenzyme A ligase (4CL) and 1 up-regulated chalcone synthase (CHS) were found. Conclusions: This is the first report of Boesenbergia rotunda de novo transcriptome data that could serve as a reference for gene or enzyme functional studies in the Zingiberaceae family. Although enzymes that are directly involved in the panduratin A biosynthetic pathway were not completely elucidated, the data provides an overall picture of gene regulation patterns leading to panduratin A production.

Heterozygous mutations in the RYR1 gene were observed in the large majority of AD-CCD families; however, this gene was excluded in some of AD-CCD families. Objective To enlarge the genetic spectrum of AD-CCD demonstrating mutations in an additional gene. Patients and methods Four affected AD family members over three generations, three of whom were alive and participate in the study: the mother and two of three siblings. The symptoms began during the early childhood with mild delayed motor development. Later they developed mainly tibialis anterior weakness, hypertrophy of calves and significant weakness (amyotrophic) of quadriceps. No cardiac or ocular involvement was noted. Results The muscle biopsies sections showed a particular pattern: eccentric cores in type 1 fibres, associated with type 1 predominance. Most cores have abrupt borders. Electron microscopy confirmed the presence of both unstructured and structured cores. Exome sequencing analysis identified a novel heterozygous missense mutation p. Leu1723Pro in MYH7 segregating with the disease and affecting a conserved residue in the myosin tail domain. Conclusions We describe MYH7 as an additional causative gene for AD-CCD. These findings have important implications for diagnosis and future investigations of AD-congenital myopathies with cores, without cardiomyopathy, but presenting a particular involvement of distal and quadriceps muscles.

Therefore, it is important to obtain reliable epidemiological data on the spread of this new infectious agent, a need that may be best met by the development of novel molecular methods. Here, a new method was described for the detection of avian influenza A/H7N9 using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Using serial dilutions of avian influenza A H7N9 cultures, the detection limit of the assay was determined to be approximately 3.2 x 10(-4) HAUs (hemagglutination units) for the H7 gene and 6.4 x 10(-4) HAUs for N9 gene. In tests of serial dilutions of in vitro-transcribed avian influenza A H7 and N9 gene RNA, positive results were obtained for target RNA containing at least three copies of the H7 gene and six copies of the N9 gene. Thirteen throat swabs from H7N9 patients were tested; all tested positive in the assay. Specificity was evaluated by testing 18 other subtypes of influenza viruses; all tested negative. A total of 180 throat swabs from patients infected with influenza virus, including 60 from patients infected with seasonal influenza A/H1N1 virus, 60 from patients infected with pandemic influenza A/H1N1/2009 virus, 30 from patients infected with seasonal influenza A/H3N2 virus and 30 from patients infected with influenza B virus, were also tested; all tested negative.

More than 100 susceptibility loci were identified in Western IBD studies, but susceptibility gene has not been found in Chinese IBD patients till now. Sequencing of individuals with an IBD family history is a powerful approach toward our understanding of the genetics and pathogenesis of IBD. The aim of this study, which focuses on a Han Chinese CD family, is to identify high-risk variants and potentially novel loci using whole exome sequencing technique. Methods: Exome sequence data from 4 individuals belonging to a same family were analyzed using bioinformatics methods to narrow down the variants associated with CD. The potential risk genes were further analyzed by genotyping and Sanger sequencing in family members, additional 401 healthy controls (HC), 278 sporadic CD patients, 123 UC cases, a pair of monozygotic CD twins and another Chinese CD family. Results: From the CD family in which the father and daughter were affected, we identified a novel single nucleotide variant (SNV) c.374T>C (p.I125T) in exon 4 of discs large homolog 1 (DLG1), a gene has been reported to play mutiple roles in cell proliferation, T cell polarity and T cell receptor signaling. After genotyping among case and controls, a PLINK analysis showed the variant was of significance (P<0.05). 4 CD patients of the other Chinese family bore another non-synonymous variant c.833G>A (p.R278Q) in exon 9 of DLG1. Conclusions: We have discovered novel genetic variants in the coding regions of DLG1 gene, the results support that DLG1 is a novel potential susceptibility gene for CD in Chinese patients.

Here we aim to detect HPV DNA in various tissues from patients with breast carcinoma using the method of HPV capture combined with massive paralleled sequencing (MPS). To validate the confidence of our methods, 15 cervical cancer samples were tested by PCR and the new method. Results showed that there was 100% consistence between the two methods. DNA from peripheral blood, tumor tissue, adjacent lymph nodes and adjacent normal tissue were collected from seven malignant breast cancer patients, and HPV type 16(HPV16) was detected in 1/7, 1/7, 1/7and 1/7 of patients respectively. Peripheral blood, tumor tissue and adjacent normal tissue were also collected from two patients with benign breast tumor, and 1/2, 2/2 and 2/2 was detected to have HPV16 DNA respectively. MPS metrics including mapping ratio, coverage, depth and SNVs were provided to characterize HPV in samples. The average coverage was 69% and 61.2% for malignant and benign samples respectively. 126 SNVs were identified in all 9 samples. The maximum number of SNVs was located in the gene of E2 and E4 among all samples. Our study not only provided an efficient method to capture HPV DNA, but detected the SNVS, coverage, SNV type and depth. The finding has provided further clue of association between HPV16 and breast cancer.																	1932-6203					MAR 10	2014	9	3							e90343	10.1371/journal.pone.0090343								WOS:000332839300021	24614680					J	Floyd, SK; Ryan, JG; Conway, SJ; Brenner, E; Burris, KP; Burris, JN; Chen, T; Edger, PP; Graham, SW; Leebens-Mack, JH; Pires, JC; Rothfels, CJ; Sigel, EM; Stevenson, DW; Stewart, CN; Wong, GKS; Bowman, JL				Floyd, Sandra K.; Ryan, Joseph G.; Conway, Stephanie J.; Brenner, Eric; Burris, Kellie P.; Burris, Jason N.; Chen, Tao; Edger, Patrick P.; Graham, Sean W.; Leebens-Mack, James H.; Pires, J.

Origin of a novel regulatory module by duplication and degeneration of an ancient plant transcription factor	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION												It is commonly believed that gene duplications provide the raw material for morphological evolution. Both the number of genes and size of gene families have increased during the diversification of land plants. Several small proteins that regulate transcription factors have recently been identified in plants, including the LITTLE ZIPPER (ZPR) proteins. ZPRs are post-translational negative regulators, via heterodimerization, of class III Homeodomain Leucine Zipper (C3HDZ) proteins that play a key role in directing plant form and growth. We show that ZPR genes originated as a duplication of a C3HDZ transcription factor paralog in the common ancestor of euphyllophytes (ferns and seed plants). The ZPRs evolved by degenerative mutations resulting in loss all of the C3HDZ functional domains, except the leucine zipper that modulates dimerization. ZPRs represent a novel regulatory module of the C3HDZ network unique to the euphyllophyte lineage, and their origin correlates to a period of rapid morphological changes and increased complexity in land plants. The origin of the ZPRs illustrates the significance of gene duplications in creating developmental complexity during land plant evolution that likely led to morphological evolution.

However, studies have suggested that differences exist regarding tumor behavior and molecular biology of these cancers, comprehensive investigations are needed to guide the clinical management of UTUC. In recent years, massively parallel sequencing has allowed insights into the biology of many cancers, and molecular prognostic markers based on this approach are rapidly emerging. The goal of this study was to characterize the gene expression patterns of UTUC using massively parallel sequencing, and identify potential molecular markers for prognosis in patients with UTUC. Methods: We compared the genome-wide mRNA expression profile of cancer and matched normal tissues from 10 patients with UTUC to identify significantly deregulated genes. We also examined the protein levels of prognostic marker candidates in 103 patients with UTUC, and tested the association of these markers with overall survival using Kaplan-Meier model and Cox regression. Results: Functional enrichment of significantly deregulated genes revealed that expression patterns of UTUC were characterized by disorders of cell proliferation and metabolism. And we also compared the expression profile of UTUC with that of bladder UC. Our results highlighted both shared (e.g. disorders of cell cycling and growth signal transduction) and tumor-specific (e.g. abnormal metabolism in UTUC and disruptions of adhesion pathways in bladder UC) features of these two cancers. Importantly, we identified that low protein expression of ALDH2 while high CCNE1 and SMAD3 were significantly associated with increased depth (*P < 0.05) and lower overall survival (***P < 0.0001) in an independent set of 103 patients. Multivariate Cox regression revealed that all these three genes were independent prognostic indicators in patients with UTUC (***P < 0.001). Conclusions: In conclusion, our study characterized the comprehensive expression profile of UTUC and highlighted both commons and differences in expression patterns between UTUC and bladder UC. And we, for the first time, revealed that ALDH2, CCNE1 and SMAD3 are associated with prognosis in patients with UTUC.																	1471-2407					NOV 18	2014	14								836	10.1186/1471-2407-14-836								WOS:000345161600001	25408144					J	Ferchaud, AL; Pedersen, SH; Bekkevold, D; Jian, JB; Niu, YC; Hansen, MM				Ferchaud, Anne-Laure; Pedersen, Susanne H.; Bekkevold, Dorte; Jian, Jianbo; Niu, Yongchao; Hansen, Michael M.			A low-density SNP array for analyzing differential selection in freshwater and marine populations of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus)	BMC GENOMICS												Background: The threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) has become an important model species for studying both contemporary and parallel evolution. In particular, differential adaptation to freshwater and marine environments has led to high differentiation between freshwater and marine stickleback populations at the phenotypic trait of lateral plate morphology and the underlying candidate gene Ectodysplacin (EDA). Many studies have focused on this trait and candidate gene, although other genes involved in marine-freshwater adaptation may be equally important. In order to develop a resource for rapid and cost efficient analysis of genetic divergence between freshwater and marine sticklebacks, we generated a low-density SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) array encompassing markers of chromosome regions under putative directional selection, along with neutral markers for background. Results: RAD (Restriction site Associated DNA) sequencing of sixty individuals representing two freshwater and one marine population led to the identification of 33,993 SNP markers. Ninety-six of these were chosen for the low-density SNP array, among which 70 represented SNPs under putatively directional selection in freshwater vs. marine environments, whereas 26 SNPs were assumed to be neutral. Annotation of these regions revealed several genes that are candidates for affecting stickleback phenotypic variation, some of which have been observed in previous studies whereas others are new. Conclusions: We have developed a cost-efficient low-density SNP array that allows for rapid screening of polymorphisms in threespine stickleback. The array provides a valuable tool for analyzing adaptive divergence between freshwater and marine stickleback populations beyond the well-established candidate gene Ectodysplacin (EDA).

To elucidate the causative gene defects, we used the next generation sequencing (NGS) to map the breakpoints of a chromosome insertion from an azoospermic male who carries a balanced, maternally inherited karyotype 46, XY, inv ins (18,7) (q22.1; q36.2q21.11). The analysis revealed that the breakage in chromosome 7 disrupts two genes, dipeptidyl aminopeptidase-like protein 6 (DPP6) and contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CACNA2D1), the former participates in regulation of voltage-gated potassium channels, and the latter is one of the components in voltage-gated calcium channels. The deletion and duplication were not identified equal or beyond 100 kb, but 4 homologous DNA elements were verified proximal to the breakpoints. One of the proband's sisters inherited the same aberrant karyotype and experienced recurrent miscarriages and consecutive fetus death, while in contrast, another sister with a normal karyotype experienced normal labor and gave birth to healthy babies. The insertional translocation is confirmed with FISH and the Y-chromosome microdeletions were excluded by genetic testing. This is the first report describing chromosome insertion inv ins (18,7) and attributes DPP6 and CACNA2D1 to azoospermia. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

More than twenty KCNQ4 mutations have been reported, but none of them were detected in Chinese mainland families. In this study, we identified a novel KCNQ4 mutation in a five generation Chinese family with 84 members and a known KCNQ4 mutation in a six generation Chinese family with 66 members. Mutation screening of 30 genes for ADNSHL was performed in the probands from thirty large Chinese families with ADNSHL by targeted region capture and high-throughput sequencing. The candidate variants and the co-segregation of the phenotype were verified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and Sanger sequencing in all ascertained family members. Then we identified a novel KCNQ4 mutation p.W275R in exon 5 and a known KCNQ4 mutation p.G285S in exon 6 in two large Chinese ADNSHL families segregating with post-lingual high frequency-involved and progressive sensorineural hearing loss. This is the first report of KCNQ4 mutation in Chinese mainland families. KCNQ4, a member of voltage-gated potassium channel family, is likely to be a common gene in Chinese patients with ADNSHL. The results also support that the combination of targeted enrichment and high-throughput sequencing is a valuable molecular diagnostic tool for autosomal dominant hereditary deafness.

Upland rice, widely adopted in rainfed upland areas in virtue of its little water requirement, contains abundant untapped genetic resources, such as genes for drought adaptation. With water shortage exacerbated and population expanding, the need for breeding crop varieties with drought adaptation becomes more and more urgent. However, a previous oversight in upland rice research reveals little information regarding its genetic mechanisms for upland adaption, greatly hindering progress in harnessing its genetic resources for breeding and cultivation. Results: In this study, we selected 84 upland and 82 irrigated accessions from all over the world, phenotyped them under both irrigated and dry land environments, and investigated the phylogenetic relations and population structure of the upland ecotype using whole genome variation data. Further comparative analysis yields a list of differentiated genes that may account for the phenotypic and physiological differences between upland and irrigated rice. Conclusions: This study represents the first genomic investigation in a large sample of upland rice, providing valuable gene list for understanding upland rice adaptation, especially drought-related adaptation, and its subsequent utilization in modern agriculture.																	1471-2229					JUN 11	2014	14								160	10.1186/1471-2229-14-160								WOS:000338162900001	24920279					J	Dusatkova, P; Fang, MY; Pruhova, S; Gjesing, AP; Cinek, O; Hansen, T; Pedersen, OB; Xu, X; Lebl, J				Dusatkova, Petra; Fang, Mingyan; Pruhova, Stepanka; Gjesing, Anette P.; Cinek, Ondrej; Hansen, Torben; Pedersen, Oluf B.; Xu, Xun; Lebl, Jan			Lessons from whole-exome sequencing in MODYX families	DIABETES RESEARCH AND CLINICAL PRACTICE												We report the first results from whole-exome sequencing performed in families with Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young without a known genetic cause of diabetes (MODYX).

We developed an optimized SNP calling method using TMAP and GATK (OTG-snpcaller). This method combined our own optimized processes, Remove Duplicates According to AS Tag (RDAST) and Alignment Optimize Structure (AOS), together with TMAP and GATK, to call SNPs from Proton data. We sequenced four sets of exomes captured by Agilent SureSelect and NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Kit, using Life Technology's Ion Proton sequencer. Then we applied OTG-snpcaller and compared our results with the results from Torrent Variants Caller. The results indicated that OTG-snpcaller can reduce both false positive and false negative rates. Moreover, we compared our results with Illumina results generated by GATK best practices, and we found that the results of these two platforms were comparable. The good performance in variant calling using GATK best practices can be primarily attributed to the high quality of the Illumina sequences.																	1932-6203					MAY 13	2014	9	5							e97507	10.1371/journal.pone.0097507								WOS:000336369200123	24824529					J	Jia, YF; Zhao, HY; Shi, DH; Peng, W; Xie, LW; Wang, W; Jiang, FM; Zhang, HY; Wang, XT				Jia, Yifang; Zhao, Heyong; Shi, Donghong; Peng, Wen; Xie, Luwen; Wang, Wei; Jiang, Fuman; Zhang, Hongyun; Wang, Xietong			Genetic effects of a 13q31.1 microdeletion detected by noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PATHOLOGY												Microdeletions of chromosome 13q31.1 are relatively rare. These types of deletions may cause different genetic effects on genotypes and/or phenotypes. There are several ways to detect microdeletions; noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) is the newest detection method. In this study, we aimed to investigate the genetic effects of a 13q31.1 microdeletion detected by NIPT and to reconfirm the feasibility of this procedure in predicting sub-chromosomal copy number variations (CNVs). The 13q31.1 microdeletion, which has previously been described as a disease-associated fragment, was detected by NIPT in a pregnant woman. To validate the finding and to explain the origin of this sub-chromosomal CNV, we collected fetal amniotic fluid and parental blood samples and tested the samples using array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). Karyotype analysis was performed on all of the samples to rule out balanced or mosaic anomalies. The aCGH results confirmed the NIPT findings. We detected the same type of microdeletion in the fetus and the mother via aCGH. The mother had a normal phenotype; therefore, in a post-test genetic counseling session, we predicted a normal phenotype for the fetus. After delivery, the normal phenotype of the newborn confirmed our prediction. Based on the present study, this 13q31.1 microdeletion may be considered as a chromosomal polymorphism. This study also reconfirmed the feasibility of obtaining a molecular karyotype of a fetus via NIPT.																	1936-2625						2014	7	10					7003	7011										WOS:000345135900069	25400788					J	Xiu, XF; Yuan, JZ; Deng, X; Xiao, JJ; Xu, HB; Zeng, ZY; Guan, LP; Xu, FP; Deng, S				Xiu, Xiaofei; Yuan, Jinzhong; Deng, Xiong; Xiao, Jingjing; Xu, Hongbo; Zeng, Zhaoyang; Guan, Liping; Xu, Fengping; Deng, Sheng			A Novel COL4A5 Mutation Identified in a Chinese Han Family Using Exome Sequencing	BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL												Alport syndrome (AS) is a monogenic disease of the basement membrane (BM), resulting in progressive renal failure due to glomerulonephropathy, variable sensorineural hearing loss, and ocular anomalies. It is caused by mutations in the collagen type IV alpha-3 gene (COL4A3), the collagen type IV alpha-4 gene (COL4A4), and the collagen type IV alpha-5 gene (COL4A5), which encodes type IV collagen alpha 3, alpha 4, and alpha 5 chains, respectively. To explore the disease-related gene in a four-generation Chinese Han pedigree of AS, exome sequencing was conducted on the proband, and a novel deletion mutation c.499delC (p.Pro167Gln fs*36) in the COL4A5 gene was identified. This mutation, absent in 1,000 genomes project, HapMap, dbSNP132, YH1 databases, and 100 normal controls, cosegregated with patients in the family. Neither sensorineural hearing loss nor typical COL4A5-related ocular abnormalities (dot-and-fleck retinopathy, anterior lenticonus, and the rare posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy) were present in patients of this family. The phenotypes of patients in this AS family were characterized by early onset-age and rapidly developing into end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Our discovery broadens the mutation spectrum in the COL4A5 gene associated with AS, which may also shed new light on genetic counseling for AS.																	2314-6133	2314-6141					2014									186048	10.1155/2014/186048								WOS:000339191100001						J	Lin, L; Luo, YL; Sorensen, P; Praetorius, H; Vajta, G; Callesen, H; Pribenszky, C; Bolund, L; Kristensen, TN				Lin, Lin; Luo, Yonglun; Sorensen, Peter; Praetorius, Helle; Vajta, Gabor; Callesen, Henrik; Pribenszky, Csaba; Bolund, Lars; Kristensen, Torsten Nygard			Effects of high hydrostatic pressure on genomic expression profiling of porcine parthenogenetic activated and cloned embryos	REPRODUCTION FERTILITY AND DEVELOPMENT												Handmade cloning (HMC) has been used to generate transgenic pigs for biomedical research. Recently, we found that parthenogenetic activation (PA) of porcine oocytes and improved HMC efficiency could be achieved by treatment with sublethal high hydrostatic pressure (HHP). However, the molecular mechanism underlying the effects of HHP treatment on embryonic development is poorly understood and so was investigated in the present study. Thus, in the present study, we undertook genome-wide gene expression analysis in HHP-treated and untreated oocytes, as well as in 4-cell and blastocyst stage embryos derived by PA or HMC. Hierarchical clustering depicted stage-specific genomic expression profiling. At the 4-cell and blastocyst stages, 103 and 163 transcripts were differentially expressed between the HMC and PA embryos, respectively (P < 0.05). These transcripts are predominantly involved in regulating cellular differentiation, gene expression and cell-to-cell signalling. We found that 44 transcripts were altered by HHP treatment, with most exhibiting lower expression in HHP-treated oocytes. Genes involved in embryonic development were prominent among the transcripts affected by HHP. Two of these genes (INHBB and ME3) were further validated by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We also observed that HHP treatment activated expression of the imprinting gene DLX5 in 4-cell PA embryos. In conclusion, our genomic expression profiling data suggest that HHP alters the RNA constitution in porcine oocytes and affects the expression of imprinting genes during embryonic development.

To under-stand the molecular mechanisms regulating this semilunar spawning rhythm, we cloned all melatonin receptor subtypes (mtnr1a1.4, mtnr1a1.7, mtnr1b, and mtnr1c). Expression of three melatonin receptor subtypes (except mtnr1c) was found in the ovaries. In contrast, the expression of all receptor subtypes was found in the diencephalon and the pituitary. In the fully-grown follicles, only mtnr1a1.7 mRNA was detected in both the isolated follicle layers and denuded oocytes. Interestingly, the transcript levels of both mtnr1a1.4 in the diencephalon and mtnr1a1.7 in the ovary displayed two cycles within one lunar month, and peaked around the first and last lunar quarters. We used 17 alpha,20 beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (DHP), a maturation-inducing hormone, as a biomarker to examine the involvement of melatonin receptors in the control of the spawning cycle. Melatonin significantly increased the plasma DHP level 1 h post intraperitoneal injection. Melatonin also directly stimulated ovarian fragments in vitro to produce a significantly higher amount of DHP. Taken together, these results provided the first evidence that melatonin receptors were involved in the synchronization of the semilunar spawning rhythm in the female mudskipper by acting through the HPG axis and/or directly on ovarian tissues to stimulate the production of DHP.

Although the social cultural impacts of Genghis Khan and the Mongolian population have been well documented, explorations of their genome structure and genetic imprints on other human populations have been lacking. We here present the genome of a Mongolian male individual. The genome was de novo assembled using a total of 130.8-fold genomic data produced from massively parallel whole-genome sequencing. We identified high-confidence variation sets, including 3.7 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 756,234 short insertions and deletions. Functional SNP analysis predicted that the individual has a pathogenic risk for carnitine deficiency. We located the patrilineal inheritance of the Mongolian genome to the lineage D3a through Y haplogroup analysis and inferred that the individual has a common patrilineal ancestor with Tibeto-Burman populations and is likely to be the progeny of the earliest settlers in East Asia. We finally investigated the genetic imprints of Mongolians on other human populations using different approaches. We found varying degrees of gene flows between Mongolians and populations living in Europe, South/Central Asia, and the Indian subcontinent. The analyses demonstrate that the genetic impacts of Mongolians likely resulted from the expansion of the Mongolian Empire in the 13th century. The genome will be of great help in further explorations of modern human evolution and genetic causes of diseases/traits specific to Mongolians.

Currently, commercial F-1 cultivars are produced through the use of artificial emasculation which is a very laborious procedure, particularly in view of the composite capitulum structure. To date, no male sterile line is available in this species, but the isolation of such material would provide a valuable tool for the establishment of an efficient cross-pollination system for the production of F-1 hybrids. In this study, we report the characterization of a novel pollen abortion mutant of Tagetes patula which was isolated from 1,796 heat shock induced cutting seedlings. Histological and cytological observation demonstrated that the abnormal development of the microspores during the binucleate pollen stage led to pollen abortion, and this was correlated to premature tapetum degeneration. Cross hybridization experiments indicated that a recessive nuclear gene was responsible for the trait. This novel male sterile mutant of Tagetes patula appears to be an applicable material for improving the breeding efficiency of the species and may be used to significantly improve ornamental traits in F-1 generations.																	0014-2336	1573-5060				NOV	2014	200	2					159	173		10.1007/s10681-014-1116-2								WOS:000343810100001						J	Ge, SF; Wang, XW; Xie, JP; Yi, X; Liu, F				Ge, Shanfei; Wang, Xiaowei; Xie, Jianping; Yi, Xin; Liu, Fei			Deep sequencing analysis of microRNA expression in porcine serum-induced hepatic fibrosis rats	ANNALS OF HEPATOLOGY												Aim. Recent studies have suggested miRNA dysregulation in liver tissue mediates the pathogenesis of various liver diseases especially liver fibrosis, but the microRNA changes during PS-induced hepatic fibrosis are still unknown. The purpose of this study was to screen the miRNA differences in rat liver fibrosis model and clarify the relationship of miRNAs with the development of PS-induced liver fibrosis. Material and methods. Two fibrotic and two normal liver tissues from 20 Sprague-Dawley rats were collected and sequenced. MiRNA profiling results and fibrosis-related genes were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and bioinformatics was used to predict miRNA targets. Results. In total, 48 miRNAs were detected to be aberrantly expressed in fibrosis tissue compared to normal tissue. Further functional analysis of the deregulated miRNA targets revealed the miRNAs are involved in several biological functions and pathways. In addition, the expression level of miR-27a and miR-146b and fibrosis-related genes were significantly up-regulated by using qRT-PCR in fibrotic liver tissues when compared to the normal liver tissues. Conclusion. PS-induced hepatic fibrosis results in up-regulation of the miR-27a and miR-146b in liver tissues, suggestingmiR-27a and miR-146b would be associated with the development of PS-induced liver fibrosis and be potential therapeutic targets during hepatic fibrosis.																	1665-2681					JUL-AUG	2014	13	4					439	449										WOS:000341467300014	24927615					J	Zhou, YZ; Pope, PB; Li, SC; Wen, B; Tan, FJ; Cheng, S; Chen, J; Yang, JL; Liu, F; Lei, XJ; Su, QQ; Zhou, C; Zhao, J; Dong, XZ; Jin, T; Zhou, X; Yang, S; Zhang, GY; Yang, HM; Wang, J; Yang, RF; Eijsink, VGH; Wang, J				Zhou, Yizhuang; Pope, Phillip B.; Li, Shaochun; Wen, Bo; Tan, Fengji; Cheng, Shu; Chen, Jing; Yang, Jinlong; Liu, Feng; Lei, Xuejing; Su, Qingqing; Zhou, Chengran; Zhao, Jiao; Dong, Xiuzhu; Jin, Tao; Zhou, Xin; Yang, Shuang; Zhang, Gengyun; Yang, Huangming; Wang, Jian; Yang, Ruifu; Eijsink, Vincent G.

Here we interpret genomic and proteomic information generated from a cellulolytic microbial consortium ( termed F1RT) enriched from soil. Analyses of reconstructed bacterial draft genomes from all seven uncultured phylotypes in F1RT indicate that its constituent microbes cooperate in both cellulose-degrading and other important metabolic processes. Support for cellulolytic inter-species cooperation came from the discovery of F1RT microbes that encode and express complimentary enzymatic inventories that include both extracellular cellulosomes and secreted free-enzyme systems. Metabolic reconstruction of the seven F1RT phylotypes predicted a wider genomic rationale as to how this particular community functions as well as possible reasons as to why biomass conversion in nature relies on a structured and cooperative microbial community.

C-M			ADAR1 deaminase contributes to scheduled skeletal myogenesis progression via stage-specific functions	CELL DEATH AND DIFFERENTIATION												Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) catalyzes cellular RNA adenosine-to-inosine editing events on structured RNA molecules. In line with this critical role, ADAR1 exhibits ubiquitous expression and is essential for embryonic development. However, regulation and developmental significance of this RNA editor in a spatiotemporal context are largely elusive. Here we unveil a novel tissue-specific role of ADAR1 in skeletal myogenesis. ADAR1 expression displayed programmed alteration that is coordinated with differentiation cues, and mediated negatively by miRNA-1/206. Coincidently, ADAR1 exerts stage-dependent functions-suppression of apoptosis at the onset of differentiation and preservation of timely myotube formation through later phase. Furthermore, the post-transcriptional aspect of its myogenic role was illustrated by the spectrum of binding RNAs, as revealed by high-throughput approach, as well as by direct regulation of myogenesis-associated targets such as dynamin 1/2 (Dnm1/2) and annexin A4. Consequently, maintenance of target gene expression profiles likely contributes to a state of cytoskeleton and membrane dynamics that is amenable to myoblast morphogenesis. Collectively, these findings uncover a critical link of ADAR1 to myogenesis, and further highlight an epigenetic mechanism by which ADAR1 and miR-1/206 interplay to control scheduled myoblast-myotube transition.

To develop and implement a community based model for cervical cancer prevention that allows the communities to manage the screening and the healthcare system to focus resources on evaluation and management of the positives. Methods. Using self-sampling and the concepts founded in Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR), we progressively developed a model to efficiently reach the women, especially rural communities; and collect the volume of samples needed to support high throughput centralized low cost per case processing. Results. 8382 eligible women, ages 35 to 59, in 130 rural communities participated. The screening was organized by the local government administration and conducted by the community leaders (as). The model used was progressively designed through detailed assessment of key elements at 6 decision points in 26 workshops that were used to train the CLs and the local promoters. The communities were able to accurately conduct the screening; in the final model a local medical worker conducted a 50-minute workshop featuring instructional posters and structured role-play. A manual and a workshop DVD were created for distribution to and implementation by local governments. The average callback rate was 84.3%, without involvement of the local doctors in the management of the positives. Conclusion. An efficient community based model capable of massive screening events was developed. We believe that the callback rate will be further improved when local doctors are trained in the management of the positives. Many elements impact coverage and further research is needed to define the influence of the identified key variables. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The mechanisms of pathogenesis triggered by H. pylori are less well known. In this study, we report the genome sequence and genomic characterizations of H. pylori strain HLJ039 that was isolated from a patient with gastric cancer in the Chinese province of Heilongjiang, where there is a high incidence of gastric cancer. To investigate potential genomic features that may be involved in pathogenesis of carcinoma, the genome was compared to three previously sequenced genomes in this area. Result: We obtained 42 contigs with a total length of 1,611,192 bp and predicted 1,687 coding sequences. Compared to strains isolated from gastritis and ulcers in this area, 10 different regions were identified as being unique for HLJ039; they mainly encoded type II restriction-modification enzyme, type II m6A methylase, DNA-cytosine methyltransferase, DNA methylase, and hypothetical proteins. A unique 547-bp fragment sharing 93% identity with a hypothetical protein of Helicobacter cinaedi ATCC BAA-847 was not present in any other previous H. pylori strains. Phylogenetic analysis based on core genome single nucleotide polymorphisms shows that HLJ039 is defined as hspEAsia subgroup, which belongs to the hpEastAsia group. Conclusion: DNA methylations, variations of the genomic regions involved in restriction and modification systems, are the "hot" regions that may be related to the mechanism of H. pylori-induced gastric cancer. The genome sequence will provide useful information for the deep mining of potential mechanisms related to East Asian gastric cancer.																	1757-4749					FEB 24	2014	6								5	10.1186/1757-4749-6-5								WOS:000333103800001	24565107					J	Gao, F; Wang, R; Liu, MY				Gao, Fei; Wang, Rui; Liu, Mingyuan			Trichinella spiralis, potential model nematode for epigenetics and its implication in metazoan parasitism	FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY												The recent discovery of DNA methylation in the nematode T.spiralis may raise the possibility of using it as a potential model organism for epigenetic studies instead of C. elegans, which is deficient in this important epigenetic modification. In contrast to the free-living nematode C. elegans, T. spiralis is a parasitic worm that possesses a complicated life cycle and undergoes a complex developmental regulation of genes. We emphasize that the differential methylomes in the different life-history stages of T. spiralis can provide insight on how DNA methylation is triggered and regulated. In particular, we have demonstrated that DNA methylation is involved in the regulation of its parasitism-related genes. Further computational analyses indicated that the regulatory machinery for DNA methylation can also be found in the T. spiralis genome. By a logical extension of this point, we speculate that comprehensively addressing the epigenetic machinery of T. spiralis may help to understand epigenetics in invertebrates. Furthermore, considering the implication of epigenetics in metazoan parasitism, using T. spiralis as an epigenetic model organism may further contribute to drug development against metazoan parasites.																	1664-042X					JAN 10	2014	4								UNSP 410	10.3389/fphys.2013.00410								WOS:000346777500001	24454291					S	Cui, YB; Liao, XK; Zhu, XQ; Wang, BQ; Peng, SL		SaezRodriguez, J; Rocha, MP; FdezRiverola, F; Santana, JFD		Cui, Yingbo; Liao, Xiangke; Zhu, Xiaoqian; Wang, Bingqiang; Peng, Shaoliang			mBWA: A Massively Parallel Sequence Reads Aligner	8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS OF COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY & BIOINFORMATICS (PACBB 2014)	Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing				8th International Conference on Practical Applications of Computational Biology & Bioinformatics (PACBB)	JUN 04-06, 2014	Univ Salamanca, Salamanca, SPAIN	Telefonica Digital, Indra, Ingn Software Avanzado S A, IBM, IEEE Syst Man & Cybernet Soc Spain, Asociac Espanola Para Inteligencia Artificial, Associacao Portuguesa Para Inteligencia Artificial, Ctr Natl Rech Scientifique, Unive Salamanca, Bioinformat Intelligent Syst & Educ Technol Res Grp, Univ Vigo, Next Generat Comp Syst Grp	Univ Salamanca			Mapping sequenced reads to a reference genome, also known as sequence reads alignment, is central for sequence analysis. Emerging sequencing technologies such as next generation sequencing (NGS) lead to an explosion of sequencing data, which is far beyond the process capabilities of existing alignment tools. Consequently, sequence alignment becomes the bottleneck of sequence analysis. Intensive computing power is required to address this challenge. A key feature of sequence alignment is that different reads are independent. Considering this property, we proposed a multi-level parallelization strategy to speed up BWA, a widely used sequence alignment tool and developed our massively parallel sequence aligner: mBWA. mBWA contains two levels of parallelization: firstly, parallelization of data input/output (IO) and reads alignment by a three-stage parallel pipeline; secondly, parallelization enabled by Intel Many Integrated Core (MIC) coprocessor technology. In this paper, we demonstrate that mBWA outperforms BWA by a combination of those techniques. To the best of our knowledge, mBWA is the first sequence alignment tool to run on Intel MIC and it can achieve more than 5-fold speedup over the original BWA while maintaining the alignment precision.																	2194-5357		978-3-319-07581-5; 978-3-319-07580-8				2014	294						113	120		10.1007/978-3-319-07581-5_14								WOS:000351276700014						J	Xiao, K; Chen, PX; Chang, DC				Xiao, Kang; Chen, Pengxuan; Chang, Donald Choy			The VTLISFG motif in the BH1 domain plays a significant role in regulating the degradation of Mcl-1	FEBS OPEN BIO												Mcl-1 is a member of the Bcl-2 family protein; its degradation is required for the initiation of apoptosis. The mechanism, however, is not yet clearly known. Previously, it was reported that Mcl-1 is degraded through the ubiquitination-mediated pathway and the PEST domain is the motif responsible for promoting this degradation. We found evidence that this may not be true. We generated several Mcl-1 deletion mutants and examined their effects on protein stability. Deletion of the PEST domain did not prevent the degradation of Mcl-1 during apoptosis. The BH1 domain, but not the PEST, BH3 or BH2 domain, exhibited a short half-life. A peptide named "F3"(VTLISFG) in the C-terminus of the BH1 domain appears to be critical for the rapid turnover of Mcl-1. Deletion of F3 from GFP-Mcl-1-Delta PEST retarded the degradation of this mutant. F3 appeared to be the minimum functional sequence of the degradation motif, since deletion of a single residue was sufficient to abrogate its short half-life. Fusion of F3 with p32 resulted in the degradation of p32 during UV-induced apoptosis, while wild type p32 was not affected. Taken together, these findings suggest that F3 (VTLISFG), instead of PEST, is the major motif responsible for the degradation of Mcl-1 during apoptosis. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Methods: 900 cases of MPS data from a previous study were reviewed, in which 100 and 800 cases were used as training and validation set, respectively. The percentage of uniquely mapped sequencing reads on Y chromosome was calculated and used to classify male and female cases. Eight pregnant women who are carriers of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) mutations were recruited, whose plasma were subjected to multiplex sequencing and fetal sex determination analysis. Results: In the training set, a sensitivity of 96% and false positive rate of 0% for male cases detection were reached in our method. The blinded validation results showed 421 in 423 male cases and 374 in 377 female cases were successfully identified, revealing sensitivity and specificity of 99.53% and 99.20% for fetal sex determination, at as early as 12 gestational weeks. Fetal sex for all eight DMD genetic counseling cases were correctly identified, which were confirmed by amniocentesis. Conclusions: Based on MPS, high accuracy of non-invasive fetal sex determination can be achieved. This method can potentially be used for prenatal genetic counseling.																	1476-7058	1476-4954				DEC	2014	27	18					1829	1833		10.3109/14767058.2014.885942								WOS:000344769500001	24444365					J	Sun, ZF; Zhang, YH; Guo, JF; Sun, QY; Mei, JP; Zhou, HL; Guan, LP; Tian, JY; Hu, ZM; Li, JD; Xia, K; Yan, XX; Tang, BS				Sun, Zhan-fang; Zhang, Yu-han; Guo, Ji-feng; Sun, Qi-ying; Mei, Jun-pu; Zhou, Han-lin; Guan, Li-ping; Tian, Jin-yong; Hu, Zheng-mao; Li, Jia-da; Xia, Kun; Yan, Xin-xiang; Tang, Bei-sha			Genetic Diagnosis of Two Dopa-Responsive Dystonia Families by Exome Sequencing	PLOS ONE												Dopa-responsive dystonia, a rare disorder typically presenting in early childhood with lower limb dystonia and gait abnormality, responds well to levodopa. However, it is often misdiagnosed with the wide spectrum of phenotypes. By exome sequencing, we make a rapid genetic diagnosis for two atypical dopa-responsive dystonia pedigrees. One pedigree, presented with prominent parkinsonism, was misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease until a known mutation in GCH1 (GTP cyclohydrolase 1) gene (NM_000161.2: c.631_632delAT, p.Met211ValfsX38) was found. The other pedigree was detected with a new compound heterozygous mutation in TH (tyrosine hydroxylase) gene [(NM_000360.3: c.911C>T, p.Ala304Val) and (NM_000360.3: c.1358G>A, p.Arg453His)], whose proband, a pregnant woman, required a rapid and less-biased genetic diagnosis. In conclusion, we demonstrated that exome sequencing could provide a precise and rapid genetic testing in the diagnosis of Mendelian diseases, especially for diseases with wide phenotypes.																	1932-6203					SEP 2	2014	9	9							e106388	10.1371/journal.pone.0106388								WOS:000341231500086	25181484					J	Yang, YJ; Yang, CC; Zhu, YM; Chen, HX; Zhao, R; He, XY; Tao, LJ; Wang, P; Zhou, LJ; Zhao, L; Tu, M; Dong, ZR; Chen, H; Xie, ZG				Yang, Yongjia; Yang, Chuanchun; Zhu, Yimin; Chen, Haixiao; Zhao, Rui; He, Xinyu; Tao, Lijuan; Wang, Pin; Zhou, Lijun; Zhao, Liu; Tu, Ming; Dong, Zirui; Chen, Hui; Xie, Zhiguo			Intragenic and extragenic disruptions of FOXL2 mapped by whole genome low-coverage sequencing in two BPES families with chromosome reciprocal translocation	GENOMICS												Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder that affects craniofacial development and ovarian function. FOXL2 is the only gene known to be responsible for BPES. The majority of BPES patients show intragenic mutations of FOXL2. Recently, a 7.4 kb sequence disruption, which was 283 kb upstream of FOXL2, was identified to independently contribute to the BPES phenotype. Several breakpoints nearing FOXL2 (0 Mb to 1.2 Mb, several of which were distant from the 7.4 kb sequence disruption) have been mapped or deduced through a traditional method in BPES patients with chromosome reciprocal translocation. In this study, two BPES families with chromosome reciprocal translocation were investigated. Intragenic mutations of FOXL2 or pathogenic copy number variations were excluded for the two BPES families. All of the four breakpoints were identified at a base-precise manner using Giemsa banding and whole genome low-coverage sequencing (WGLCS). In family 01, the breakpoints were found at chr1:95,609,998 and chr3:138,879, 114 (213,132 bp upstream of FOXL2). In family 02, the breakpoints were located at chr3:138,665,431 (intragenic disruptions of FOXL2) and chr20:56,924,609. Results indicate that the intragenic and extragenic interruptions of FOXL2 can be accurately and rapidly detected using WGLCS. In addition, both the 213 kb upstream and intragenic interruptions of FOXL2 can cause BPES phenotype. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Variation and association to diabetes in 2000 full mtDNA sequences mined from an exome study in a Danish population	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS												In this paper, we mine full mtDNA sequences from an exome capture data set of 2000 Danes, showing that it is possible to get high-quality full-genome sequences of the mitochondrion from this resource. The sample includes 1000 individuals with type 2 diabetes and 1000 controls. We characterise the variation found in the mtDNA sequence in Danes and relate the variation to diabetes risk as well as to several blood phenotypes of the controls but find no significant associations. We report 2025 polymorphisms, of which 393 have not been reported previously. These 393 mutations are both very rare and estimated to be caused by very recent mutations but individuals with type 2 diabetes do not possess more of these variants. Population genetics analysis using Bayesian skyline plot shows a recent history of rapid population growth in the Danish population in accordance with the fact that >40% of variable sites are observed as singletons.

In this study, RNA-sequencing technology was used to analyze the responses of human monocytes THP1 to Yersinia pestis infection. Over 6000 genes were differentially expressed over the 12 h infection. Kinetic responses of pathogen recognition receptor signaling pathways, apoptosis, antigen processing, and presentation pathway and coagulation system were analyzed in detail. Among them, RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling pathway, which was established for antiviral defense, was significantly affected. Mice lacking MAVS, the adaptor of the RLR signaling pathway, were less sensitive to infection and exhibited lower IFN-beta production, higher Th1-type cytokines IFN-gamma and IL-12 production, and lower Th2-type cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 production in the serum compared with wild-type mice. Moreover, infection of pathogenic bacteria other than Y. pestis also altered the expression of the RLR pathway, suggesting that the response of RLR pathway to bacterial infection is a universal mechanism.																	1673-8527	1873-5533				JUL 20	2014	41	7					379	396		10.1016/j.jgg.2014.05.006								WOS:000340842500003	25064677					J	Guo, YH; Li, YH; Su, LX; Chang, D; Liu, WB; Wang, T; Yuan, YT; Fang, XQ; Wang, JF; Li, TZ; Fang, CX; Dai, WK; Liu, CT				Guo, Yinghua; Li, Yinhu; Su, Longxiang; Chang, De; Liu, Wenbin; Wang, Tong; Yuan, Yanting; Fang, Xiangqun; Wang, Junfeng; Li, Tianzhi; Fang, Chengxiang; Dai, Wenkui; Liu, Changting			Comparative genomic analysis of Klebsiella pneumonia (LCT-KP214) and a mutant strain (LCT-KP289) obtained after spaceflight	BMC GENOMICS												Background: With the development of space science, it is important to analyze the relationship between the space environment and genome variations that might cause phenotypic changes in microbes. Klebsiella pneumoniae is commonly found on the human body and is resistant to multiple drugs. To study space-environment-induced genome variations and drug resistance changes, K. pneumoniae was carried into outer space by the Shenzhou VIII spacecraft. Results: The K. pneumoniae strain LCT-KP289 was selected after spaceflight based on its phenotypic differences compared to the ground-control strain. Analysis of genomic structural variations revealed one inversion, 25 deletions, fifty-nine insertions, two translocations and six translocations with inversions. In addition, 155 and 400 unique genes were observed in LCT-KP214 and LCT-KP289, respectively, including the gene encoding dihydroxyacetone kinase, which generates the ATP and NADH required for microbial growth. Furthermore, a large number of mutant genes were related to transport and metabolism. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that most genes in these two strains had a dN/ dS value greater than 1, indicating that the strain diversity increased after spaceflight. Analysis of drug-resistance phenotypes revealed that the K. pneumoniae strain LCT-KP289 was resistant to sulfamethoxazole, whereas the control strain, LCT-KP214, was not; both strains were resistant to benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, lincomycin, vancomycin, chloramphenicol and streptomycin. The sulfamethoxazole resistance may be associated with sequences in Scaffold7 in LCT-KP289, which were not observed in LCT-K214; this scaffold contained the gene sul1. In the strain LCT-KP289, we also observed a drug-resistance integron containing emrE (confers multidrug resistance) and ant (confers resistance to spectinomycin, streptomycin, tobramycin, kanamycin, sisomicin, dibekacin, and gentamicin). The gene ampC (confers resistance to penicillin, cephalosporin-ii and cephalosporin-i) was present near the integron. In addition, 30 and 26 drug-resistance genes were observed in LCT-KP289 and LCT-KP214, respectively. Conclusions: Comparison of a K. pneumoniae strain obtained after spaceflight with the ground-control strain revealed genome variations and phenotypic changes and elucidated the genomic basis of the acquired drug resistance. These data pave the way for future studies on the effects of spaceflight.																	1471-2164					JUL 12	2014	15								589	10.1186/1471-2164-15-589								WOS:000209596600001	25015528					J	Shi, Q; Chung, JS				Shi, Q.; Chung, J. Sook			Trehalose metabolism in the blue crab Callinectes sapidus: Isolation of multiple structural cDNA isoforms of trehalose-6-phosphate synthase and their expression in muscles	GENE												Adult blue crab Callinectes sapidus exhibit behavioral and ecological dimorphisms: females migrating from the low salinity water to the high salinity area vs. males remaining in the same areas. The flesh basal muscle of the swimming paddle shows a dimorphic color pattern in that levator (Lev) and depressor (Dep) of females tend to be much darker than those of males, while both genders have the same light colored remoter (Rem) and promoter (Pro). The full-length cDNA sequence of four structural isoforms of trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) is isolated from chela muscles of an adult female, C. sapidus. Two isoforms of the C sapidus TPS encode functional domains of TPS and trehalose-6-phosphorylase (TPP) in tandem as a fused gene product of Escherichia coli Ost A and Ost B. The other two isoforms contain only a single TPS domain. In both males and females, the darker (Lev + Dep) muscles exhibit greater amounts of trehalose, TPS and trehalase activities than the light colored (Rem + Pro). The fact that adult females show higher levels of trehalase activity in the basal muscles and of glucose in Lev + Dep than those of adult males suggests that there may be a metabolic dimorphism. Moreover, the involvement of trehalose in energy metabolism that was examined under the condition of strenuous swimming activity mimicked in adult females demonstrates the intrinsic trehalose metabolism in Lev + Dep, which subsequently results in hemolymphatic hyperglycemia and hyperlactemia. Our data support that trehalose serves as an additional carbohydrate source of hemolymphatic hyperglycemia in this species. Behavioral and ecological dimorphisms of C sapidus adults may be supported by a functional dimorphism in energy metabolism. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Genome sequencing by high throughput technologies is currently feasible and popular, leading to the burst of deciphered bacterial genome sequences. Utilizing the flooding genomic data for source tracing of pathogens in outbreaks is promising, and challenging as well. Here, we employed Yersinia pestis genomes from a plague outbreak at Xinghai county of China in 2009 as an example, to develop a simple two-step strategy for rapid source tracing of the outbreak. The first step was to define the phylogenetic position of the outbreak strains in a whole species tree, and the next step was to provide a detailed relationship across the outbreak strains and their suspected relatives. Through this strategy, we observed that the Xinghai plague outbreak was caused by Y. pestis that circulated in the local plague focus, where the majority of historical plague epidemics in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau may originate from. The analytical strategy developed here will be of great help in fighting against the outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, by pinpointing the source of pathogens rapidly with genomic epidemiological data and microbial forensics information.

Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia complicated with acquired disease is extremely rare. We report a 44 years old male patient with more than 20 years of chronic progressive bilateral ptosis and limitation of eye movements manifested dysarthria, dysphagia and neck muscle weakness for 3 years. The first muscle biopsy showed red-ragged fibers and cytochrome c oxidase negative fibers as well as inflammatory cells infiltration. Electron microscopy revealed paracrystalline inclusions. Mitochondrial genetic analysis demonstrated a large-scale mtDNA deletion of m.8470_13446del4977. The patient was treated with prednisone. In a three-year follow-up study, the second biopsy was performed. Before the treatment, except bilateral ptosis and external ophthalmopelgia, this patient presented bulbar muscle weakness and neck muscle weakness. After treated with prednisone, the symptoms of dysphagia, dysarthria and neck muscle weakness were significantly improved, and the second biopsy showed only mitochondrial myopathy pathology but the inflammations disappeared. Here, we report a patient with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia complicated with inflammatory myopathy and after treated with prednisone as myositis, he had a significant therapeutic effect.																	1936-2625						2014	7	12					8887	8892										WOS:000348345900064	25674260					J	Ye, YH; Yu, P; Yong, J; Zhang, T; Wei, XM; Qi, M; Jin, F				Ye, Yinghui; Yu, Ping; Yong, Jing; Zhang, Ting; Wei, Xiaoming; Qi, Ming; Jin, Fan			Preimplantational Genetic Diagnosis and Mutation Detection in a Family with Duplication Mutation of DMD Gene	GYNECOLOGIC AND OBSTETRIC INVESTIGATION												Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive neuromuscular disease caused by mutation in the DMD gene. A 38-year-old woman was referred to our pital with her son who was diagnosed with DMD. Multiplex PCR failed to detect DMD mutations in the affected child. The female carrier underwent preimplantation genetic diagnosis by linkage analysis and gender determination. Eight embryos were biopsied after in vitro fertilization. Two healthy embryos determined both as females (E1 and E3) were transferred. Although the paternal allele was absent in E3, it was considered to be a result of allele dropout for the STR-49 marker. Surprisingly, a female and a male baby were delivered at 38 gestational weeks, suggesting that E3 was a male embryo with the allele dropout occurring at the SRY gene. Exon 2 duplication was detected in the DMD patient and the carrier mother using next-generation sequencing and multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification. Next, we verified the duplication of exon 2 by real-time PCR, using a special primer at 3' of intron 1, very close to exon 2. Finally, we confirmed that both newborns inherited the normal allele, using quantitative real-time PCR and linkage analysis. (C) 2014 S.

But no significant differences were observed in firmness, ethylene production, MaLOX1, MaACS1 and MaACO1 expression levels between propylene and propylene SA-treated fruit. These results indicated that the LOX activity increasing and JA burst in the early stage of cold storage may play a key role in tolerance the chilling stress in banana fruit. Banana fruit are sensitive to chilling stress. This study investigated the possible mechanism of propylene-reducing chilling injury (CI) to postharvest banana fruit. Firmness, chromaticity, ethylene production, CI index, electrolyte leakage, lipoxygenases (LOX) activity, contents of jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) and the expression of genes MaLOX1, MaACS1 and MaACO1 in fruit were examined. The study shows that the propylene treatment delayed CI symptom development and chromaticity change by 2 days. Meantime, the treatment reduced electrolyte leakage, induced LOX activity in the early stage of cold storage and increased JA content in banana peel. SA immersion after propylene treatment improved the SA content in banana peel, but inhibited the LOX activity and JA content increasing, resulting in CI symptom as serious as that of untreated controls. Expression of genes MaLOX1, MaACS1 and MaACO1 in banana fruit was enhanced by propylene treatment. But no significant differences were observed in firmness, ethylene production, MaLOX1, MaACS1 and MaACO1 expression levels between propylene and propylene SA-treated fruit.

The patients' father and mother carried a heterozygous allele at different locations of the ERCC6 gene, which was confirmed by Sanger DNA sequencing. The two mutations are both located in the highly conserved motif I of ATP-binding helicase and are considered "Damaging,'' "Probably Damaging,'' "Disease Causing,'' and "Conserved'', indicating the role of DNA damage in the pathogenetic process of the disease. The results not only enrich the ERCC6 mutations database, but also indicate that whole exome sequencing will be a powerful tool for discovering the disease causing mutations in clinical diagnosis.																	1932-6203					DEC 2	2014	9	12							e113914	10.1371/journal.pone.0113914								WOS:000345869700069	25463447					J	Cauda, E; Sheehan, M; Gussman, R; Kenny, L; Volkwein, J				Cauda, Emanuele; Sheehan, Maura; Gussman, Robert; Kenny, Lee; Volkwein, Jon			An Evaluation of Sharp Cut Cyclones for Sampling Diesel Particulate Matter Aerosol in the Presence of Respirable Dust	ANNALS OF OCCUPATIONAL HYGIENE												Two prototype cyclones were the subjects of a comparative research campaign with a diesel particulate matter sampler (DPMS) that consists of a respirable cyclone combined with a downstream impactor. The DPMS is currently used in mining environments to separate dust from the diesel particulate matter and to avoid interferences in the analysis of integrated samples and direct-reading monitoring in occupational environments. The sampling characteristics of all three devices were compared using ammonium fluorescein, diesel, and coal dust aerosols. With solid spherical test aerosols at low particle loadings, the aerodynamic size-selection characteristics of all three devices were found to be similar, with 50% penetration efficiencies (d(50)) close to the design value of 0.8 mu m, as required by the US Mine Safety and Health Administration for monitoring occupational exposure to diesel particulate matter in US mining operations. The prototype cyclones were shown to have 'sharp cut' size-selection characteristics that equaled or exceeded the sharpness of the DPMS. The penetration of diesel aerosols was optimal for all three samplers, while the results of the tests with coal dust induced the exclusion of one of the prototypes from subsequent testing. The sampling characteristics of the remaining prototype sharp cut cyclone (SCC) and the DPMS were tested with different loading of coal dust. While the characteristics of the SCC remained constant, the deposited respirable coal dust particles altered the size-selection performance of the currently used sampler. This study demonstrates that the SCC performed better overall than the DPMS.																	0003-4878	1475-3162				OCT	2014	58	8					995	1005		10.1093/annhyg/meu045								WOS:000344239100007	25060240					J	Hudson, NJ; Baker, ML; Hart, NS; Wynne, JW; Gu, Q; Huang, ZY; Zhang, GJ; Ingham, AB; Wang, LF; Reverter, A				Hudson, Nicholas J.; Baker, Michelle L.; Hart, Nathan S.; Wynne, James W.; Gu, Quan; Huang, Zhiyong; Zhang, Guojie; Ingham, Aaron B.; Wang, Linfa; Reverter, Antonio			Sensory Rewiring in an Echolocator: Genome-Wide Modification of Retinogenic and Auditory Genes in the Bat Myotis davidii	G3-GENES GENOMES GENETICS												Bats comprise 20% of all mammalian species and display a number of characteristics, including true flight, echolocation, and a heightened ability to resist viral load that uniquely position this group for comparative genomic studies. Here we searched for evidence of genomic variation consistent with sensory rewiring through bat evolution. We focused on two species with divergent sensory preferences. Myotis davidii is a bat species that echolocates and possesses dim-but not daylight-adapted vision whereas the black flying fox (Pteropus alecto) has highly developed day vision but does not echolocate. Using the naked mole rat as a reference, we found five functional genes (CYP1A2, RBP3, GUCY2F, CRYBB1, and GRK7) encoding visual proteins that have degenerated into pseudogenes in M. davidii but not P. alecto. In a second approach genome-wide codon usage bias (CUB) was compared between the two bat species. This CUB ranking systematically enriched for vision-related (CLN8, RD3, IKZF1, LAMC3, CRX, SOX8, VAX2, HPS1, RHO, PRPH2, and SOX9) and hearing-related (TPRN, TMIE, SLC52A3, OTOF, WFS1, SOD1, TBX18, MAP1A, OTOS, GPX1, and USH1G) machinery in M. davidii but not P. alecto. All vision and hearing genes selectively enriched in M. davidii for which orthologs could be identified also were more biased in the echolocating M. lucifugus than the nonecholocating P. vampyrus. We suggest that the existence of codon bias in vision-and hearing-related genes in a species that has evolved echolocation implies CUB is part of evolution's toolkit to rewire sensory systems. We propose that the two genetic changes (pseudogene formation and CUB) collectively paint a picture of that incorporates a combination of destruction and gain-of-function. Together, they help explain how natural selection has reduced physiological costs associated with the development of a smaller eye poorly adapted to day vision but that also contribute to enhanced dim light vision and the hearing adaptations consonant with echolocation.

The tunnel structure is assumed to be a moderately thick cylindrical shell that was never previously used, and all following researches were done on this basis. To begin, the vibration equation of the tunnel structure was established based on the moderately thick cylindrical shells theory, which takes into account transverse shear deformation. Then, a motion equation was set up for the soil around the tunnel in the framework of Navier's wave theory, applicable to a homogeneous, isotropic, linear elastic medium. Based on said analysis and combined with a wave-propagation approach, the vibration control equation of the tunnel structure was established by considering soil-structure dynamic interaction according to the interface conditions. Using the dispersion characteristic equation, the vibration characteristics of the tunnel structure were analyzed. Through the comparison of the analytical results with those obtained based on thin shell theory or the FEM, the effectiveness of this research was verified. Finally, the influences of tunnel radius, wall thickness, and length on the vibration characteristics of tunnel structure were analyzed. Some important findings are drawn as follows: (1) The natural frequencies of each order, calculated using the method proposed in this paper, are close to the solutions based on FEM, and the relative error is less than 10%; (2) The natural frequencies of the tunnel structure that were calculated based on this theory are lower than those based on the thin shell theory; (3) Additional stiffness is the main influencing factor of the soil medium on the vibration characteristics of tunnel structure; (4) When the lower order is dominating in one-modal analysis, it would produce a larger error if soil-structure interaction is ignored; and (5) The natural frequency of tunnel structure decreases with the increase of tunnel radius, wall thickness, and length.

We herein identified four related subjects with CRS and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) from geographically disperse Chinese Han communities and performed exome capture and sequencing of one affected individual and unaffected parents. We found a novel mutation in DNAH5 (c. 8030G > A) in CRS and PCD which was different from those attributed to cystic fibrosis and a defect of cilia motility in a Chinese family through exome capture and sequencing. Our findings showed that c. 8030G > A of DNAH5 may be implicated as the disease-causing gene of CRS and PCD in this Chinese family, which may expand the understanding of clinicians on the pathogenesis of CRS. Moreover, the identification of this novel mutation in DNAH5 indirectly indicates that exome capture and sequencing are beneficial in the genetic research of midget consanguinity families.																	0937-4477	1434-4726				JUN	2014	271	6					1589	1594		10.1007/s00405-013-2788-2								WOS:000335782000037	24150548					J	Li, WW; Wang, QH; Chen, JJ; Zhou, J; Zhou, XY; Xie, P				Li WenWen; Wang QuanHui; Chen JianJun; Zhou Jian; Zhou XinYu; Xie Peng			A multiple-reaction-monitoring mass spectrometric method for simultaneous quantitative analysis of five plasma apolipoproteins	SCIENCE CHINA-CHEMISTRY												A multiplexed targeted proteomic assay using a mTRAQ-MRM/MS-based approach was developed and assessed to systematically quantify the relative expressions of five candidate plasma apolipoproteins that have been previously shown to be dysregulated in neuropsychiatric disorders and cognitive dysfunction: apolipoprotein H (APOH), apolipoprotein J (APOJ), apolipoprotein A4 (APOA4), apolipoprotein E (APOE), and apolipoprotein D (APOD). The peptides and transitions of each APO were carefully selected according to the tandem MS signals acquired on a TripleTOF (TM) 5600, followed by optimization of the declustering potential and collision energy voltages for transitions on a QTRAP 5500. Our results showed that the collision energies of mTRAQ-labeled peptides were approximately 15%-20% higher than corresponding non-labeled peptides. Through optimized transitions and parameters, we analyzed the relative abundances of the five APOs in human plasma with and without depletion of high abundant proteins. The results indicated that the MRM signals of four target APOs were significantly increased after depletion, while the MRM signal of one APO, APOD, was decreased. Furthermore, the relative abundances of the five target APOs in healthy human plasma were stable, and the ranking of these proteins according to their MS responses changed slightly. Therefore, we deduced that the rank order of the MS signals for these target proteins can be developed as a diagnostic signature for diseased plasma.																	1674-7291	1869-1870				MAY	2014	57	5					723	731		10.1007/s11426-013-5036-0								WOS:000335735200010						J	Bonafe, L; Liang, JL; Gorna, MW; Zhang, QY; Ha-Vinh, R; Campos-Xavier, AB; Unger, S; Beckmann, JS; Le Bechec, A; Stevenson, B; Giedion, A; Liu, XZ; Superti-Furga, G; Wang, W; Spahr, A; Superti-Furga, A				Bonafe, Luisa; Liang, Jinlong; Gorna, Maria W.; Zhang, Qingyan; Ha-Vinh, Russia; Campos-Xavier, Ana Belinda; Unger, Sheila; Beckmann, Jacques S.; Le Bechec, Antony; Stevenson, Brian; Giedion, Andres; Liu, Xuanzhu; Superti-Furga, Giulio; Wang, Wei; Spahr, Andre; Superti-Furga, Andrea			MMP13 Mutations are the Cause of Recessive Metaphyseal Dysplasia, Spahr Type	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS PART A												Metaphyseal dysplasia, Spahr type (MDST; OMIM 250400) was described in 1961 based on the observation of four children in one family who had rickets-like metaphyseal changes but normal blood chemistry and moderate short stature. Its molecular basis and nosologic status remained unknown. We followed up on those individuals and diagnosed the disorder in an additional member of the family. We used exome sequencing to ascertain the underlying mutation and explored its consequences on three-dimensional models of the affected protein. The MDST phenotype is associated with moderate short stature and knee pain in adults, while extra-skeletal complications are not observed. The sequencing showed that MDST segregated with a c.619T>G single nucleotide transversion in MMP13. The predicted non-conservative amino acid substitution, p.Trp207Gly, disrupts a crucial hydrogen bond in the calcium-binding region of the catalytic domain of the matrix metalloproteinase, MMP13. The MDST phenotype is associated with recessive MMP13 mutations, confirming the importance of this metalloproteinase in the metaphyseal growth plate. Dominant MMP13 mutations have been associated with metaphyseal anadysplasia (OMIM 602111), while a single child homozygous for a MMP13 mutation had been previously diagnosed as recessive metaphyseal anadysplasia, that we conclude is the same nosologic entity as MDST. Molecular confirmation of MDST allows distinction of it from dominant conditions (e.g., metaphyseal dysplasia, Schmid type; OMIM # 156500) and from more severe multi-system conditions (such as cartilage-hair hypoplasia; OMIM # 250250) and to give precise recurrence risks and prognosis.

This study explores the characterization of Serratia marcescensis grown in a spaceflight environment at the phenotypic, transcriptomic and proteomic levels. From November 1, 2011 to November 17, 2011, a strain of S. marcescensis was sent into space for 398 h on the Shenzhou VIII spacecraft, and ground simulation was performed as a control (LCT-SM213). After the flight, two mutant strains (LCT-SM166 and LCT-SM262) were selected for further analysis. Although no changes in the morphology, post-culture growth kinetics, hemolysis or antibiotic sensitivity were observed, the two mutant strains exhibited significant changes in their metabolic profiles after exposure to spaceflight. Enrichment analysis of the transcriptome showed that the differentially expressed genes of the two spaceflight strains and the ground control strain mainly included those involved in metabolism and degradation. The proteome revealed that changes at the protein level were also associated with metabolic functions, such as glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, pyruvate metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism and the degradation of valine, leucine and isoleucine. In summary S. marcescens showed alterations primarily in genes and proteins that were associated with metabolism under spaceflight conditions, which gave us valuable clues for future research.

Genetic factors are responsible for approximately 50% of cases with congenital hearing loss. However, no previous studies have documented the clinical phenotype and genetic basis of autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss in Mongolians. Methods: In this study, we performed exon capture sequencing of a Mongolian family with hereditary hearing loss and identified a novel mutation in TECTA gene, which encodes alpha - tectorin, a major component of the inner ear extracellular matrix that contacts the specialized sensory hair cells. Results: The novel G -> T missense mutation at nucleotide 6016 results in a substitution of amino acid aspartate at 2006 with tyrosine (Asp2006Tyr) in a highly conserved zona pellucida (ZP) domain of alpha tectorin. The mutation is not found in control subjects from the same family with normal hearing and a genotype-phenotype correlation is observed. Conclusion: A novel missense mutation c.6016 G > T ( p.Asp2006Tyr) of TECTA gene is a characteristic TECTA-related mutation which causes autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss. Our result indicated that mutation in TECTA gene is responsible for the hearing loss in this Mongolian family.																	1471-2350					MAR 19	2014	15								34	10.1186/1471-2350-15-34								WOS:000334537900001	25008054					J	Zhu, JF; Zheng, WM				Zhu, Jianfeng; Zheng, Wei-Mou			Self-organizing approach for meta-genomes	COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												We extend the self-organizing approach for annotation of a bacterial genome to analyze the raw sequencing data of the human gut metagenome without sequence assembling. The original approach divides the genomic sequence of a bacterium into non-overlapping segments of equal length and assigns to each segment one of seven 'phases', among which one is for the noncoding regions, three for the direct coding regions to indicate the three possible codon positions of the segment starting site, and three for the reverse coding regions. The noncoding phase and the six coding phases are described by two frequency tables of the 64 triplet types or 'codon usages'. A set of codon usages can be used to update the phase assignment and vice versa. An iteration after an initialization leads to a convergent phase assignment to give an annotation of the genome. In the extension of the approach to a metagenome, we consider a mixture model of a number of categories described by different codon usages. The Illumina Genome Analyzer sequencing data of the total DNA from faecal samples are then examined to understand the diversity of the human gut microbiome. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study was performed to examine the role of the transforming growth factor 13 (TGF beta/p65 pathway under TIIA treatment in a glomerular mesangial cell model of DN. Firstly, it was identified that TIIA inhibited the proliferation of HBZY-1 cells, while simultaneously suppressing the expression of TGF beta and p65. In addition, glucose-induced HBZY-1 cells were treated with TIIA, si-TGF beta and si-p65. The results revealed that si-TGF beta or si-p65 were able to inhibit the proliferation of HBZY-1 cells as well. Finally, the expression of TGF beta and p65 in a rat model of DN treated with TIIA was detected. The results demonstrated that renal hypertrophy and 24 h urinary protein excretion were ameliorated in TIIA-treated rats with DN. Furthermore, it was revealed that the protein levels of TGF beta and p65 were decreased in the DN rats following TIIA treatment. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that TGF beta and p65 were activated by TIIA in HBZY-1 cells. In addition, the expression of TGF beta and of p65 was downregulated in rats with DN treated with TIIA.																	1791-2997	1791-3004				NOV	2014	10	5					2471	2476		10.3892/mmr.2014.2497								WOS:000344424000038	25174411					J	Niu, FS; Yu, SS; Zhang, ZX; Yi, X; Ye, LL; Tang, W; Qiu, CC; Wen, HB; Sun, YJ; Gao, J; Guo, YP				Niu, Fusheng; Yu, Shanshan; Zhang, Zhenxin; Yi, Xin; Ye, Lili; Tang, Wei; Qiu, Changchun; Wen, Hongbo; Sun, Yujing; Gao, Jing; Guo, Yupu			A novel mutation in the PSEN2 gene (N141Y) associated with early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease in a Chinese Han family	NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING												The mutations in the presenilin 2 (PSEN2) gene as causes of early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) have never been reported in Asia. We conducted a phenotype and pedigree study by performing neuropathological examination and target region sequencing in a family of 3 generations. Six members in this family developed dementia in their fifth decade and died in their sixth decade. The proband was diagnosed clinically with AD, which was confirmed by an autopsy. Target region sequencing showed a novel missense mutation at codon 141 (N141Y) of the PSEN2 gene that predicts an Asparagine-to-Tyrosine substitution in the affected individuals. The result was validated by Sanger sequencing in 7 family members (2 affected and 5 unaffected). The mutation was absent in the 5 clinically unaffected relatives and 188 control subjects. No influence of the APOE genotype was observed. We are the first to demonstrate a novel PSEN2 N141Y mutation in a Chinese Han family with early-onset AD. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We performed a quantitative proteomics analysis to investigate differential protein expression in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells infected with recombinant and wild-type influenza viruses to determine whether NA replacement would alter host cell gene expression. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-TOF MS) and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), we identified 12 up-regulated and 49 down-regulated protein spots, including cytoskeletal proteins, molecular biosynthesis proteins, ubiquitin-proteasome pathway proteins, and heat shock proteins. The most significant changes in infected cells were observed for molecular biosynthesis proteins. We found more differentially expressed protein spots in cells infected with rPR8-H5N1NA or rPR8-H9N2NA viruses than cells infected with wild-type virus. Many of those proteins are postulated to be involved in cell-cell fusion, but the full mechanism remains to be explored. Meanwhile, our data demonstrate that the wild-type virus has evolutionary advantages over recombinant viruses.

The compression process is first divided into two parallel tasks: data process task and data input task. Then, the data process task is further divided into two parts: Title data process part and other data process part. Three high parallelism models for the Title data processing are developed: multi-CPU model, CPU+GPU model and CPU+MIC model. All three models are tested, and the result shows that nearly 3x acceleration can be achieved. The maximum throughput observed among all tested cases is 144MB/S, and the average throughput is 120MB/S. Research finds that the acceleration ratio depends on the types of sequencing platforms. The program performs better on data from the ILLUMINA and SOLiD sequencing platforms. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

For the known viruses, do we know their prevalence, even in our experimental systems? Here we report a virus survey using recently published small (s)RNA sequencing datasets. The sRNA reads were assembled and contigs were screened for virus homologues against the NCBI nucleotide (nt) database using the BLASTn program. To our surprise, approximately 30% (28 out of 94) of publications had highly scored viral sequences in their datasets. Among them, only two publications reported virus infections. Though viral vectors were used in some of the publications, virus sequences without any identifiable source appeared in more than 20 publications. By determining the distributions of viral reads and the antiviral RNA interference (RNAi) pathways using the sRNA profiles, we showed evidence that many of the viruses identified were indeed infecting and generated host RNAi responses. As virus infections affect many aspects of host molecular biology and metabolism, the presence and impact of viruses needs to be actively investigated in experimental systems.
