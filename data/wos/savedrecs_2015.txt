Genomes Project Consortium	A global reference for human genetic variation	NATURE			English	Article							GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; COMPLEMENT FACTOR-H; MACULAR DEGENERATION; POPULATION HISTORY; BAYES FACTORS; MUTATION; DISEASE; VARIANT; SUSCEPTIBILITY; INDIVIDUALS	The 1000 Genomes Project set out to provide a comprehensive description of common human genetic variation by applying whole-genome sequencing to a diverse set of individuals from multiple populations. Here we report completion of the project, having reconstructed the genomes of 2,504 individuals from 26 populations using a combination of low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, deep exome sequencing, and dense microarray genotyping. We characterized a broad spectrum of genetic variation, in total over 88 million variants (84.7 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 3.6 million short insertions/deletions (indels), and 60,000 structural variants), all phased onto high-quality haplotypes. This resource includes >99% of SNP variants with a frequency of >1% for a variety of ancestries. We describe the distribution of genetic variation across the global sample, and discuss the implications for common disease studies.

Second-generation PLINK: rising to the challenge of larger and richer datasets	GIGASCIENCE			English	Article						GWAS; Population genetics; Whole-genome sequencing; High-density SNP genotyping; Computational statistics	HARDY-WEINBERG EQUILIBRIUM; GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; FISHERS EXACT TEST; LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM; CONTINGENCY-TABLES; EXACT TESTS; ALGORITHM; PERMUTATION; PERFORMANCE; IDENTITY	Background: PLINK 1 is a widely used open-source C/C++ toolset for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and research in population genetics. However, the steady accumulation of data from imputation and whole-genome sequencing studies has exposed a strong need for faster and scalable implementations of key functions, such as logistic regression, linkage disequilibrium estimation, and genomic distance evaluation. In addition, GWAS and population-genetic data now frequently contain genotype likelihoods, phase information, and/or multiallelic variants, none of which can be represented by PLINK 1's primary data format. Findings: To address these issues, we are developing a second-generation codebase for PLINK. The first major release from this codebase, PLINK 1.9, introduces extensive use of bit-level parallelism, O(root n)-time/constant-space Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and Fisher's exact tests, and many other algorithmic improvements. In combination, these changes accelerate most operations by 1-4 orders of magnitude, and allow the program to handle datasets too large to fit in RAM. We have also developed an extension to the data format which adds low-overhead support for genotype likelihoods, phase, multiallelic variants, and reference vs. alternate alleles, which is the basis of our planned second release ( PLINK 2.0). Conclusions: The second-generation versions of PLINK will offer dramatic improvements in performance and compatibility. For the first time, users without access to high-end computing resources can perform several essential analyses of the feature-rich and very large genetic datasets coming into use.

Applying metagenomic analysis on fecal samples from a large cohort of Swedish infants and their mothers, we characterized the gut microbiome during the first year of life and assessed the impact of mode of delivery and feeding on its establishment. In contrast to vaginally delivered infants, the gut microbiota of infants delivered by C-section showed significantly less resemblance to their mothers. Nutrition had a major impact on early microbiota composition and function, with cessation of breast-feeding, rather than introduction of solid food, being required for maturation into an adult-like microbiota. Microbiota composition and ecological network had distinctive features at each sampled stage, in accordance with functional maturation of the microbiome. Our findings establish a framework for understanding the interplay between the gut microbiome and the human body in early life.

In most of these reports, treatment regimens were not controlled for and conclusions could thus be confounded by the effects of various drugs on the microbiota, which may obscure microbial causes, protective factors or diagnostically relevant signals. Our study addresses disease and drug signatures in the human gut microbiome of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Two previous quantitative gut metagenomics studies of T2D patients that were unstratified for treatment yielded divergent conclusions regarding its associated gut microbial dysbiosis(3,4). Here we show, using 784 available human gut metagenomes, how antidiabetic medication confounds these results, and analyse in detail the effects of the most widely used antidiabetic drug metformin. We provide support for microbial mediation of the therapeutic effects of metformin through short-chain fatty acid production, as well as for potential microbiota-mediated mechanisms behind known intestinal adverse effects in the form of a relative increase in abundance of Escherichia species. Controlling for metformin treatment, we report a unified signature of gut microbiome shifts in T2D with a depletion of butyrate-producing taxa(3,4). These in turn cause functional microbiome shifts, in part alleviated by metformin-induced changes. Overall, the present study emphasizes the need to disentangle gut microbiota signatures of specific human diseases from those of medication.

Here we produce a draft genome using 181-fold paired-end sequences assisted by fivefold BAC-to-BAC sequences and a high-resolution genetic map. In our assembly 88.5% of the 2,173-Mb scaffolds, which cover 89.6%similar to 96.7% of the A(t)D(t) genome, are anchored and oriented to 26 pseudochromosomes. Comparison of this Gossypium hirsutum A(t)D(t) genome with the already sequenced diploid Gossypium arboreum (AA) and Gossypium raimondii (DD) genomes revealed conserved gene order. Repeated sequences account for 67.2% of the AtDt genome, and transposable elements (TEs) originating from D-t seem more active than from A(t). Reduction in the A(t)D(t) genome size occurred after allopolyploidization. The A or A(t) genome may have undergone positive selection for fiber traits. Concerted evolution of different regulatory mechanisms for Cellulose synthase (CesA) and 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase1 and 3 (ACO1,3) may be important for enhanced fiber production in Gossypium hirsutum.

We aim to establish clinically relevant molecular subtypes that would encompass this heterogeneity and provide useful clinical information. We use gene expression data to describe four molecular subtypes linked to distinct patterns of molecular alterations, disease progression and prognosis. The mesenchymal-like type includes diffuse-subtype tumors with the worst prognosis, the tendency to occur at an earlier age and the highest recurrence frequency (63%) of the four subtypes. Microsatellite-unstable tumors are hyper-mutated intestinal-subtype tumors occurring in the antrum; these have the best overall prognosis and the lowest frequency of recurrence (22%) of the four subtypes. The tumor protein 53 (TP53)-active and TP53-inactive types include patients with intermediate prognosis and recurrence rates (with respect to the other two subtypes), with the TP53-active group showing better prognosis. We describe key molecular alterations in each of the four subtypes using targeted sequencing and genome-wide copy number microarrays. We validate these subtypes in independent cohorts in order to provide a consistent and unified framework for further clinical and preclinical translational research.

Here we describe insights from sequencing whole genomes (low read depth, 7x) or exomes (high read depth, 80x) of nearly 10,000 individuals from population-based and disease collections. In extensively phenotyped cohorts we characterize over 24 million novel sequence variants, generate a highly accurate imputation reference panel and identify novel alleles associated with levels of triglycerides (APOB), adiponectin (ADIPOQ) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLR and RGAG1) from single-marker and rare variant aggregation tests. We describe population structure and functional annotation of rare and low-frequency variants, use the data to estimate the benefits of sequencing for association studies, and summarize lessons from disease-specific collections. Finally, we make available an extensive resource, including individual-level genetic and phenotypic data and web-based tools to facilitate the exploration of association results.

To date, no robustly replicated genetic loci have been identified(2), despite analysis of more than 9,000 cases(3). Here, using low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of 5,303 Chinese women with recurrent MDD selected to reduce phenotypic heterogeneity, and 5,337 controls screened to exclude MDD, we identified, and subsequently replicated in an independent sample, two loci contributing to risk of MDD on chromosome 10: one near the SIRT1 gene (P = 2.53 x 10(-10)), the other in an intron of the LHPP gene (P = 6.45 x10(-12)). Analysis of 4,509 cases with a severe subtype of MDD, melancholia, yielded an increased genetic signal at the SIRT1 locus. We attribute our success to the recruitment of relatively homogeneous cases with severe illness.

Concordance was observed between the gut and oral microbiomes, suggesting overlap in the abundance and function of species at different body sites. Dysbiosis was detected in the gut and oral microbiomes of RA patients, but it was partially resolved after RA treatment. Alterations in the gut, dental or saliva microbiome distinguished individuals with RA from healthy controls, were correlated with clinical measures and could be used to stratify individuals on the basis of their response to therapy. In particular, Haemophilus spp. were depleted in individuals with RA at all three sites and negatively correlated with levels of serum autoantibodies, whereas Lactobacillus salivarius was over-represented in individuals with RA at all three sites and was present in increased amounts in cases of very active RA. Functionally, the redox environment, transport and metabolism of iron, sulfur, zinc and arginine were altered in the microbiota of individuals with RA. Molecular mimicry of human antigens related to RA was also detectable. Our results establish specific alterations in the gut and oral microbiomes in individuals with RA and suggest potential ways of using microbiome composition for prognosis and diagnosis.

We previously published a study describing humans with inherited ISG15deficiency but without unusually severe viral diseases(5). We showed that these patients were prone to mycobacterial disease and that human ISG15 was non-redundant as an extracellular IFN-gamma-inducing molecule. We show here that ISG15-deficient patients also display unanticipated cellular, immunological and clinical signs of enhanced IFN-alpha/beta immunity, reminiscent of the Mendelian autoinflammatory interferonopathies Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome and spondyloenchondrodysplasia(6-9). We further show that an absence of intracellular ISG15 in the patients' cells prevents the accumulation of USP18(10,11), a potent negative regulator of IFN-alpha/beta signalling, resulting in the enhancement and amplification of IFN-alpha/beta responses. Human ISG15, therefore, is not only redundant for antiviral immunity, but is a key negative regulator of IFN-alpha/beta immunity. In humans, intracellular ISG15 is IFN-alpha/beta-inducible not to serve as a substrate for ISGylation-dependent antiviral immunity, but to ensure USP18-dependent regulation of IFN-alpha/beta and prevention of IFN-alpha/beta-dependent autoinflammation.

The gut microbiota is believed to be directly involved in colorectal carcinogenesis. The identity and functional capacity of the adenoma-or carcinoma-related gut microbe(s), however, have not been surveyed in a comprehensive manner. Here we perform a metagenome-wide association study (MGWAS) on stools from advanced adenoma and carcinoma patients and from healthy subjects, revealing microbial genes, strains and functions enriched in each group. An analysis of potential risk factors indicates that high intake of red meat relative to fruits and vegetables appears to associate with outgrowth of bacteria that might contribute to a more hostile gut environment. These findings suggest that faecal microbiome-based strategies may be useful for early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal adenoma or carcinoma.

Non-invasive prenatal testing for trisomies 21, 18 and 13: clinical experience from 146 958 pregnancies	ULTRASOUND IN OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY			English	Article						cell-free DNA; clinical performance; CNV; false negative; false positive; low-risk population; mosaicism; NIPT; trisomy	COMMON FETAL ANEUPLOIDIES; CELL-FREE DNA; MATERNAL PLASMA; DIAGNOSIS; RISK; ABNORMALITIES; TRISOMY-13; POSITION; FRACTION; SOCIETY	ObjectivesTo report the clinical performance of massively parallel sequencing-based non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) in detecting trisomies 21, 18 and 13 in over 140000 clinical samples and to compare its performance in low-risk and high-risk pregnancies. MethodsBetween 1 January 2012 and 31 August 2013, 147314 NIPT requests to screen for fetal trisomies 21, 18 and 13 using low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of plasma cell-free DNA were received. The results were validated by karyotyping or follow-up of clinical outcomes. ResultsNIPT was performed and results obtained in 146958 samples, for which outcome data were available in 112669 (76.7%). Repeat blood sampling was required in 3213 cases and 145 had test failure. Aneuploidy was confirmed in 720/781 cases positive for trisomy 21, 167/218 cases positive for trisomy 18 and 22/67 cases positive for trisomy 13 on NIPT. Nine false negatives were identified, including six cases of trisomy 21 and three of trisomy 18. The overall sensitivity of NIPT was 99.17%, 98.24% and 100% for trisomies 21, 18 and 13, respectively, and specificity was 99.95%, 99.95% and 99.96% for trisomies 21, 18 and 13, respectively. There was no significant difference in test performance between the 72382 high-risk and 40287 low-risk subjects (sensitivity, 99.21% vs 98.97% (P=0.82); specificity, 99.95% vs 99.95% (P=0.98)). The major factors contributing to false-positive and false-negative NIPT results were maternal copy number variant and fetal/placental mosaicism, but fetal fraction had no effect. ConclusionsUsing a stringent protocol, the good performance of NIPT shown by early validation studies can be maintained in large clinical samples. This technique can provide equally high sensitivity and specificity in screening for trisomy 21 in a low-risk, as compared to high-risk, population. Copyright (c) 2015 ISUOG.

Roughly half of these tumours regress spontaneously or are cured by limited therapy. By contrast, high-risk neuroblastomas have an unfavourable clinical course despite intensive multimodal treatment, and their molecular basis has remained largely elusive(2-4). Here we have performed whole-genome sequencing of 56 neuroblastomas (high-risk, n = 39; low-risk, n = 17) and discovered recurrent genomic rearrangements affecting a chromosomal region at 5p15.33 proximal of the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (TERT). These rearrangements occurred only in high-risk neuroblastomas (12/39, 31%) in a mutually exclusive fashion with MYCN amplifications and ATRX mutations, which are known genetic events in this tumour type(1,2,5). In an extended case series (n = 217), TERT rearrangements defined a subgroup of high-risk tumours with particularly poor outcome. Despite a large structural diversity of these rearrangements, they all induced massive transcriptional upregulation of TERT. In the remaining high-risk tumours, TERT expression was also elevated in MYCN-amplified tumours, whereas alternative lengthening of telomeres was present in neuroblastomas without TERT or MYCN alterations, suggesting that telomere lengthening represents a central mechanism defining this subtype. The 5p15.33 rearrangements juxtapose the TERT coding sequence to strong enhancer elements, resulting in massive chromatin remodelling and DNA methylation of the affected region. Supporting a functional role of TERT, neuroblastoma cell lines bearing rearrangements or amplified MYCN exhibited both upregulated TERT expression and enzymatic telomerase activity. In summary, our findings show that remodelling of the genomic context abrogates transcriptional silencing of TERT in high-risk neuroblastoma and places telomerase activation in the centre of transformation in a large fraction of these tumours.

We compared the genomes of 10 bee species that vary in social complexity, representing multiple independent transitions in social evolution, and report three major findings. First, many important genes show evidence of neutral evolution as a consequence of relaxed selection with increasing social complexity. Second, there is no single road map to eusociality; independent evolutionary transitions in sociality have independent genetic underpinnings. Third, though clearly independent in detail, these transitions do have similar general features, including an increase in constrained protein evolution accompanied by increases in the potential for gene regulation and decreases in diversity and abundance of transposable elements. Eusociality may arise through different mechanisms each time, but would likely always involve an increase in the complexity of gene networks.

However, although genomic studies have identified some mutations associated with ESCC, we know little of the mutational processes responsible. To identify genome-wide mutational signatures, we performed either whole-genome sequencing (WGS) or whole-exome sequencing (WES) on 104 ESCC individuals and combined our data with those of 88 previously reported samples. An APOBEC-mediated mutational signature in 47% of 192 tumors suggests that APOBEC-catalyzed deamination provides a source of DNA damage in ESCC. Moreover, PIK3CA hotspot mutations (c.1624G> A [p.Glu542Lys] and c.1633G>A [p.Glu545Lys]) were enriched in APOBEC-signature tumors, and no smoking associated signature was observed in ESCC. In the samples analyzed by WGS, we identified focal (<100 kb) amplifications of CBX4 and CBX8. In our combined cohort, we identified frequent in activating mutations in AJUBA, ZNF750, and PTCH1 and the chromatin-remodeling genes CREBBP and BAP1, in addition to known mutations. Functional analyses suggest roles for several genes (CBX4, CBX8, AJUBA, and ZNF750) in ESCC. Notably, high activity of hedgehog signaling and the PI3K pathway in approximately 60% of 104 ESCC tumors indicates that therapies targeting these pathways might be particularly promising strategies for ESCC. Collectively, our data provide comprehensive insights into the mutational signatures of ESCC and identify markers for early diagnosis and potential therapeutic targets.

Preliminary analyses of genome sequences of 81 EBOV collected from March to June 2014 from Guinea and Sierra Leone suggest that the 2014 EBOV originated from an independent transmission event from its natural reservoir(3) followed by sustained human-to-human infections(4). It has been reported that the EBOV genome variation might have an effect on the efficacy of sequence-based virus detection and candidate therapeutics(5,6). However, only limited viral information has been available since July 2014, when the outbreak entered a rapid growth phase(7). Here we describe 175 full-length EBOV genome sequences from five severely stricken districts in Sierra Leone from 28 September to 11 November 2014. We found that the 2014 EBOV has become more phylogenetically and genetically diverse from July to November 2014, characterized by the emergence of multiple novel lineages. The substitution rate for the 2014 EBOV was estimated to be 1.23x10(-3) substitutions per site per year (95% highest posterior density interval, 1.04x10(-3) to 1.41x10(-3) substitutions per site per year), approximating to that observed between previous EBOV outbreaks. The sharp increase in genetic diversity of the 2014 EBOV warrants extensive EBOV surveillance in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia to better understand the viral evolution and transmission dynamics of the ongoing outbreak. These data will facilitate the international efforts to develop vaccines and therapeutics.

We report here on the analysis of a high-quality assembly from the 1180-megabase genome of Symbiodinium kawagutii. We annotated protein-coding genes and identified Symbiodinium-specific gene families. No whole-genome duplication was observed, but instead we found active (retro) transposition and gene family expansion, especially in processes important for successful symbiosis with corals. We also documented genes potentially governing sexual reproduction and cyst formation, novel promoter elements, and a microRNA system potentially regulating gene expression in both symbiont and coral. We found biochemical complementarity between genomes of S. kawagutii and the anthozoan Acropora, indicative of host-symbiont coevolution, providing a resource for studying the molecular basis and evolution of coral symbiosis.

By conducting whole-genome sequencing and high-throughput viral integration detection, we identified 3,667 HPV integration breakpoints in 26 cervical intraepithelial neoplasias, 104 cervical carcinomas and five cell lines. Beyond recalculating frequencies for the previously reported frequent integration sites POU5F1B (9.7%), FHIT (8.7%), KLF12 (7.8%), KLF5 (6.8%), LRP1B (5.8%) and LEPREL1 (4.9%), we discovered new hot spots HMGA2 (7.8%), DLG2 (4.9%) and SEMA3D (4.9%). Protein expression from FHIT and LRP1B was downregulated when HPV integrated in their introns. Protein expression from MYC and HMGA2 was elevated when HPV integrated into flanking regions. Moreover, microhomologous sequence between the human and HPV genomes was significantly enriched near integration breakpoints, indicating that fusion between viral and human DNA may have occurred by microhomology-mediated DNA repair pathways(2). Our data provide insights into HPV integration-driven cervical carcinogenesis.

Here we present the genome sequence of the tropical epiphytic orchid Phalaenopsis equestris, a frequently used parent species for orchid breeding. P. equestris is the first plant with crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) for which the genome has been sequenced. Our assembled genome contains 29,431 predicted protein-coding genes. We find that contigs likely to be underassembled, owing to heterozygosity, are enriched for genes that might be involved in self-incompatibility pathways. We find evidence for an orchid-specific paleopolyploidy event that preceded the radiation of most orchid clades, and our results suggest that gene duplication might have contributed to the evolution of CAM photosynthesis in P. equestris. Finally, we find expanded and diversified families of MADS-box C/D-class, B-class AP3 and AGL6-class genes, which might contribute to the highly specialized morphology of orchid flowers.

Any disruption of intra-or inter-protein interactions will alter this delicate structure, exposing hydrophobic surfaces, with consequent protein aggregation and cataract formation. Cataracts are the most common cause of blindness worldwide, affecting tens of millions of people(1), and currently the only treatment is surgical removal of cataractous lenses. The precise mechanisms by which lens proteins both prevent aggregation and maintain lens transparency are largely unknown. Lanosterol is an amphipathic molecule enriched in the lens. It is synthesized by lanosterol synthase (LSS) in a key cyclization reaction of a cholesterol synthesis pathway. Here we identify two distinct homozygous LSS missense mutations (W581R and G588S) in two families with extensive congenital cataracts. Both of these mutations affect highly conserved amino acid residues and impair key catalytic functions of LSS. Engineered expression of wild-type, but not mutant, LSS prevents intracellular protein aggregation of various cataract-causing mutant crystallins. Treatment by lanosterol, but not cholesterol, significantly decreased preformed protein aggregates both in vitro and in cell-transfection experiments. We further show that lanosterol treatment could reduce cataract severity and increase transparency in dissected rabbit cataractous lenses in vitro and cataract severity in vivo in dogs. Our study identifies lanosterol as a key molecule in the prevention of lens protein aggregation and points to a novel strategy for cataract prevention and treatment.

To study the evolution and determinants of recombination in species lacking the gene that encodes PRDM9, we inferred fine-scale genetic maps from population resequencing data for two bird species: the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, and the long-tailed finch, Poephila acuticauda. We found that both species have recombination hotspots, which are enriched near functional genomic elements. Unlike in mice and apes, most hotspots are shared between the two species, and their conservation seems to extend over tens of millions of years. These observations suggest that in the absence of PRDM9, recombination targets functional features that both enable access to the genome and constrain its evolution.

To secure high microbiome diversity, we used mouse strains of diverse genetic backgrounds, from different providers, kept in different housing laboratories and fed either a low-fat or high-fat diet. Similar to the human gut microbiome, >99% of the cataloged genes are bacterial. We identified 541 metagenomic species and defined a core set of 26 metagenomic species found in 95% of the mice. The mouse gut microbiome is functionally similar to its human counterpart, with 95.2% of its Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) orthologous groups in common. However, only 4.0% of the mouse gut microbial genes were shared (95% identity, 90% coverage) with those of the human gut microbiome. This catalog provides a useful reference for future studies.

Clues to the responsible mechanisms may lie with the discovery of molecular signatures of stress, some of which include alterations to an individual's somatic genome. Here, using genome sequences from 11,670 women, we observed a highly significant association between a stress-related disease, major depression, and the amount of mtDNA (p = 9.00 x 10(-42), odds ratio 1.33 [95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.29-1.37]) and telomere length (p = 2.84 x 10(-14), odds ratio 0.85 [95% CI = 0.81-0.89]). While both telomere length and mtDNA amount were associated with adverse life events, conditional regression analyses showed the molecular changes were contingent on the depressed state. We tested this hypothesis with experiments in mice, demonstrating that stress causes both molecular changes, which are partly reversible and can be elicited by the administration of corticosterone. Together, these results demonstrate that changes in the amount of mtDNA and telomere length are consequences of stress and entering a depressed state. These findings identify increased amounts of mtDNA as a molecular marker of MD and have important implications for understanding how stress causes the disease.

We sequenced the genomes of 69 pigs from 15 geographically divergent locations in China and detected 41 million variants, of which 21 million were absent from the dbSNP database. In a genome-wide scan, we identified a set of loci that likely have a role in regional adaptations to high-and low-latitude environments within China. Intriguingly, we found an exceptionally large (14-Mb) region with a low recombination rate on the X chromosome that appears to have two distinct haplotypes in the high-and low-latitude populations, possibly underlying their adaptation to cold and hot environments, respectively. Surprisingly, the adaptive sweep in the high-latitude regions has acted on DNA that might have been introgressed from an extinct Sus species. Our findings provide new insights into the evolutionary history of pigs and the role of introgression in adaptation.

Previous work has established that a WGD affects most lineages in the Papilionoideae and occurred sometime after the divergence of the papilionoid and mimosoid clades, but the exact timing has been unknown. The history of WGD has also not been established for legume lineages outside the Papilionoideae. We investigated the presence and timing of WGDs in the legumes by querying thousands of phylogenetic trees constructed from transcriptome and genome data from 20 diverse legumes and 17 outgroup species. The timing of duplications in the gene trees indicates that the papilionoid WGD occurred in the common ancestor of all papilionoids. The earliest diverging lineages of the Papilionoideae include both nodulating taxa, such as the genistoids (e.g., lupin), dalbergioids (e.g., peanut), phaseoloids (e.g., beans), and galegoids (= Hologalegina, e.g., clovers), and clades with nonnodulating taxa including Xanthocercis and Cladrastis (evaluated in this study). We also found evidence for several independent WGDs near the base of other major legume lineages, including the Mimosoideae-Cassiinae-Caesalpinieae (MCC), Detarieae, and Cercideae clades. Nodulation is found in the MCC and papilionoid clades, both of which experienced ancestral WGDs. However, there are numerous nonnodulating lineages in both clades, making it unclear whether the phylogenetic distribution of nodulation is due to independent gains or a single origin followed by multiple losses.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) might be a rescue therapy for refractory inflammatory bowel disease. This study aimed to evaluate the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of FMT through mid-gut for refractory Crohn's disease (CD). MethodsWe established standardized laboratory protocol and clinical work flow for FMT. Only refractory CD patients with Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) score7 were enrolled for this study. All included patients were treated with single FMT through mid-gut and assessed during follow-up. ResultsMetagenomics analysis showed a high concordance between feces sample and purified fecal microbiota from same donors. Standardized fecal microbiota preparation and clinical flow significantly simplified the practical aspects of FMT. Totally, 30 patients were qualified for the present analysis. The rate of clinical improvement and remission based on clinical activity at the first month was 86.7% (26/30) and 76.7% (23/30), respectively, which was higher than other assessment points within 15-month follow-up. Patients' body weight increased after FMT, and the lipid profile improved as well. FMT also showed a fast and continuous significant effect in relieving the sustaining abdominal pain associated with sustaining CD. ConclusionThis is a pilot study with the largest sample of patients with refractory CD who underwent single FMT. The results demonstrated that FMT through mid-gut might be a safe, feasible, and efficient rescue therapy for refractory CD.

A comprehensive assessment of somatic mutation detection in cancer using whole-genome sequencing	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							ACUTE MYELOID-LEUKEMIA; VARIANT ANALYSIS; POINT MUTATIONS; EXOME; ACCURATE; MEDULLOBLASTOMA; SIGNATURES; FRAMEWORK; CONSENSUS; ALIGNMENT	As whole-genome sequencing for cancer genome analysis becomes a clinical tool, a full understanding of the variables affecting sequencing analysis output is required. Here using tumour-normal sample pairs from two different types of cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and medulloblastoma, we conduct a benchmarking exercise within the context of the International Cancer Genome Consortium. We compare sequencing methods, analysis pipelines and validation methods. We show that using PCR-free methods and increasing sequencing depth to similar to 100 x shows benefits, as long as the tumour: control coverage ratio remains balanced. We observe widely varying mutation call rates and low concordance among analysis pipelines, reflecting the artefact-prone nature of the raw data and lack of standards for dealing with the artefacts.

It also exhibits peculiar behavioral and physiological characteristics, especially sensitive to various environmental stresses, such as hypoxia and air exposure. These traits may render L. crocea a good model for investigating the response mechanisms to environmental stress. To understand the molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying the adaptation and response of L. crocea to environmental stress, we sequenced and assembled the genome of L. crocea using a bacterial artificial chromosome and whole-genome shotgun hierarchical strategy. The final genome assembly was 679 Mb, with a contig N50 of 63.11 kb and a scaffold N50 of 1.03 Mb, containing 25,401 protein-coding genes. Gene families underlying adaptive behaviours, such as vision-related crystallins, olfactory receptors, and auditory sense-related genes, were significantly expanded in the genome of L. crocea relative to those of other vertebrates. Transcriptome analyses of the hypoxia-exposed L. crocea brain revealed new aspects of neuro-endocrine-immune/metabolism regulatory networks that may help the fish to avoid cerebral inflammatory injury and maintain energy balance under hypoxia. Proteomics data demonstrate that skin mucus of the air-exposed L. crocea had a complex composition, with an unexpectedly high number of proteins (3,209), suggesting its multiple protective mechanisms involved in antioxidant functions, oxygen transport, immune defence, and osmotic and ionic regulation. Our results reveal the molecular and genetic basis of fish adaptation and response to hypoxia and air exposure. The data generated by this study will provide valuable resources for the genetic improvement of stress resistance and yield potential in L. crocea.

Here, we perform a genome- wide and exome- wide association study on 2,119 patients with exudative AMD and 5,691 controls, with independent replication in 4,226 patients and 10,289 controls, all of East Asian descent, as part of The Genetics of AMD in Asians ( GAMA) Consortium. We find a strong association between CETP Asp442Gly ( rs2303790), an East Asian- specific mutation, and increased risk of AMD ( odds ratio ( OR) 1.70, P 5.60 10 22). The AMD risk allele ( 442Gly), known to protect from coronary heart disease, increases HDL cholesterol levels by 0.17 mmol l 1 ( P 5.82 10 21) in East Asians ( n 7,102). We also identify three novel AMD loci: C6orf223 Ala231Ala ( OR 0.78, P 6.19 10 18), SLC44A4 Asp47Val ( OR 1.27, P 1.08 10 11) and FGD6 Gln257Arg ( OR 0.87, P 2.85 10 8). Our findings suggest that some of the genetic loci conferring AMD susceptibility in East Asians are shared with Europeans, yet AMD in East Asians may also have a distinct genetic signature.

The evolutionary history of ferns inferred from 25 low-copy nuclear genes	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article						codon models; curated phylogenomics; divergence time dating; Equisetum; fern chronogram; incomplete lineage sorting; low-copy nuclear gene; model selection; monilophytes; transcriptome	EUPOLYPOD II FERNS; BAYESIAN PHYLOGENETIC INFERENCE; RBCL NUCLEOTIDE-SEQUENCES; ADIANTUM-CAPILLUS-VENERIS; LAND PLANT PHYLOGENY; CHAIN MONTE-CARLO; RETICULATE EVOLUTION; MOLECULAR EVOLUTION; FLOWERING PLANTS; DRYOPTERIS DRYOPTERIDACEAE	PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Understanding fern (monilophyte) phylogeny and its evolutionary timescale is critical for broad investigations of the evolution of land plants, and for providing the point of comparison necessary for studying the evolution of the fern sister group, seed plants. Molecular phylogenetic investigations have revolutionized our understanding of fern phylogeny, however, to date, these studies have relied almost exclusively on plastid data. METHODS: Here we take a curated phylogenomics approach to infer the first broad fern phylogeny from multiple nuclear loci, by combining broad taxon sampling (73 ferns and 12 outgroup species) with focused character sampling (25 loci comprising 35 877 bp), along with rigorous alignment, orthology inference and model selection. KEY RESULTS: Our phylogeny corroborates some earlier inferences and provides novel insights; in particular, we find strong support for Equisetales as sister to the rest of ferns, Marattiales as sister to leptosporangiate ferns, and Dennstaedtiaceae as sister to the eupolypods. Our divergence-time analyses reveal that divergences among the extant fern orders all occurred prior to similar to 200 MYA. Finally, our species-tree inferences are congruent with analyses of concatenated data, but generally with lower support. Those cases where species-tree support values are higher than expected involve relationships that have been supported by smaller plastid datasets, suggesting that deep coalescence may be reducing support from the concatenated nuclear data. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the utility of a curated phylogenomics approach to inferring fern phylogeny, and highlights the need to consider underlying data characteristics, along with data quantity, in phylogenetic studies.

Genome sequencing of the extinct Eurasian wild aurochs, Bos primigenius, illuminates the phylogeography and evolution of cattle	GENOME BIOLOGY			English	Article						Ancient DNA; Aurochs; Bos primigenius; Cattle; Domestication; Evolution; Genome; Hybridization	DOMESTIC CATTLE; ANCIENT DNA; TAURINE CATTLE; MITOCHONDRIAL GENOME; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; NEANDERTHAL GENOME; EUROPEAN AUROCHS; GENETIC-EVIDENCE; DAIRY-CATTLE; MILK-YIELD	Background: Domestication of the now-extinct wild aurochs, Bos primigenius, gave rise to the two major domestic extant cattle taxa, B. taurus and B. indicus. While previous genetic studies have shed some light on the evolutionary relationships between European aurochs and modern cattle, important questions remain unanswered, including the phylogenetic status of aurochs, whether gene flow from aurochs into early domestic populations occurred, and which genomic regions were subject to selection processes during and after domestication. Here, we address these questions using whole-genome sequencing data generated from an approximately 6,750-year-old British aurochs bone and genome sequence data from 81 additional cattle plus genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data from a diverse panel of 1,225 modern animals. Results: Phylogenomic analyses place the aurochs as a distinct outgroup to the domestic B. taurus lineage, supporting the predominant Near Eastern origin of European cattle. Conversely, traditional British and Irish breeds share more genetic variants with this aurochs specimen than other European populations, supporting localized gene flow from aurochs into the ancestors of modern British and Irish cattle, perhaps through purposeful restocking by early herders in Britain. Finally, the functions of genes showing evidence for positive selection in B. taurus are enriched for neurobiology, growth, metabolism and immunobiology, suggesting that these biological processes have been important in the domestication of cattle. Conclusions: This work provides important new information regarding the origins and functional evolution of modern cattle, revealing that the interface between early European domestic populations and wild aurochs was significantly more complex than previously thought.

Here we use a hybrid assembly approach to construct high-quality reference genomes for Papilio xuthus (contig and scaffold N50: 492 kb, 3.4Mb) and Papilio machaon (contig and scaffold N50: 81 kb, 1.15Mb), highly heterozygous species that differ in host plant affiliations, and adult and larval colour patterns. Integrating comparative genomics and analyses of gene expression yields multiple insights into butterfly evolution, including potential roles of specific genes in recent diversification. To functionally test gene function, we develop an efficient (up to 92.5%) CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing method that yields obvious phenotypes with three genes, Abdominal-B, ebony and frizzled. Our results provide valuable genomic and technological resources for butterflies and unlock their potential as a genetic model system.

Quest for Missing Proteins: Update 2015 on Chromosome-Centric Human Proteome Project	JOURNAL OF PROTEOME RESEARCH			English	Editorial Material						missing proteins; Chromosome-Centric Human Proteome Project; LC-MS; antibody enrichment; proteomics; bioinformatics	TANDEM MASS-SPECTROMETRY; DATA SETS; POSTTRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATIONS; FUNCTIONAL ANNOTATION; INTERNATIONAL-SOCIETY; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; DISSOCIATION ETHCD; STATISTICAL-MODEL; GENOME ANNOTATION; SEQUENCE DATABASE	This paper summarizes the recent activities of the Chromosome-Centric Human Proteome Project (C-HPP) consortium, which develops new technologies to identify yet-to-be annotated proteins (termed "missing proteins") in biological samples that lack sufficient experimental evidence at the protein level for confident protein identification. The C-HPP also aims to identify new protein forms that may be caused by genetic variability, post-translational modifications, and alternative splicing. Proteogenomic data integration forms the basis of the C-HPP's activities; therefore, we have summarized some of the key approaches and their roles in the project. We present new analytical technologies that improve the chemical space and lower detection limits coupled to bioinformatics tools and some publicly available resources that can be used to improve data analysis or support the development of analytical assays. Most of this paper's content has been compiled from posters, slides, and discussions presented in the series of C-HPP workshops held during 2014. All data (posters, presentations) used are available at the C-HPP Wild (http://c-hpp.webhosting.rug.nl/) and in the Supporting Information.

Transcriptome sequencing and genome-wide association analyses reveal lysosomal function and actin cytoskeleton remodeling in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							SUSCEPTIBILITY FACTOR DYSBINDIN; SCHIZOAFFECTIVE DISORDER; HUNTINGTONS-DISEASE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; GENE-EXPRESSION; FOCAL ADHESION; RNA-SEQ; COMPLEX; PATHWAY; DISC1	Schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BPD) are severe mental disorders with high heritability. Clinicians have long noticed the similarities of clinic symptoms between these disorders. In recent years, accumulating evidence indicates some shared genetic liabilities. However, what is shared remains elusive. In this study, we conducted whole transcriptome analysis of post-mortem brain tissues (cingulate cortex) from SCZ, BPD and control subjects, and identified differentially expressed genes in these disorders. We found 105 and 153 genes differentially expressed in SCZ and BPD, respectively. By comparing the t-test scores, we found that many of the genes differentially expressed in SCZ and BPD are concordant in their expression level (q <= 0.01, 53 genes; q <= 0.05, 213 genes; q <= 0.1, 885 genes). Using genome-wide association data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, we found that these differentially and concordantly expressed genes were enriched in association signals for both SCZ (P < 10(-7)) and BPD (P = 0.029). To our knowledge, this is the first time that a substantially large number of genes show concordant expression and association for both SCZ and BPD. Pathway analyses of these genes indicated that they are involved in the lysosome, Fc gamma receptor-mediated phagocytosis, regulation of actin cytoskeleton pathways, along with several cancer pathways. Functional analyses of these genes revealed an interconnected pathway network centered on lysosomal function and the regulation of actin cytoskeleton. These pathways and their interacting network were principally confirmed by an independent transcriptome sequencing data set of the hippocampus. Dysregulation of lysosomal function and cytoskeleton remodeling has direct impacts on endocytosis, phagocytosis, exocytosis, vesicle trafficking, neuronal maturation and migration, neurite outgrowth and synaptic density and plasticity, and different aspects of these processes have been implicated in SCZ and BPD.

However, only one genome is available for all amphibians, that of Xenopus tropicalis, which is distantly related from the majority of frogs. More than 96% of frogs belong to the Neobatrachia, and no genome exists for this group. This dearth of amphibian genomes greatly restricts genomic studies of amphibians and, more generally, our understanding of tetrapod genome evolution. To fill this gap, we provide the de novo genome of a Tibetan Plateau frog, Nanorana parkeri, and compare it to that of X. tropicalis and other vertebrates. This genome encodes more than 20,000 protein-coding genes, a number similar to that of Xenopus. Although the genome size of Nanorana is considerably larger than that of Xenopus (2.3 vs. 1.5 Gb), most of the difference is due to the respective number of transposable elements in the two genomes. The two frogs exhibit considerable conserved whole-genome synteny despite having diverged approximately 266 Ma, indicating a slow rate of DNA structural evolution in anurans. Multigenome synteny blocks further show that amphibians have fewer interchromosomal rearrangements than mammals but have a comparable rate of intrachromosomal rearrangements. Our analysis also identifies 11 Mb of anuran-specific highly conserved elements that will be useful for comparative genomic analyses of frogs. The Nanorana genome offers an improved understanding of evolution of tetrapod genomes and also provides a genomic reference for other evolutionary studies.

The results among different groups, however, have been inconsistent in identifying the parameters that are able to predict chromosomal abnormalities. The aim of this study was to investigate whether aneuploidy of human blastocysts was detectable by specific morphokinetic parameters in patients at increased risk of aneuploidy because of advanced maternal age, history of unsuccessful IVF treatments, or both. A longitudinal cohort study was conducted using 455 blastocysts from 138 patients. Morphokinetic features of preimplantation development were detected in a timelapse incubator. Blastocysts were subjected to trophectodermal biopsy and comprehensive chromosomal screening. Analyses were conducted by means of logistic mixed-effects models, with a subject-specific intercept. No statistical correlation between 16 commonly detected morphokinetic characteristics of in-vitro embryo development and aneuploidy was found. Results suggest that morphokinetic characteristics cannot be used to select euploid blastocysts in poor-prognosis patients regarded as candidates for pre-implantation genetic screening.

Here we report a Danish pan-genome obtained from sequencing 10 trios to high depth (50 x). We report 536k novel SNVs and 283k novel short indels from mapping approaches and develop a population-wide de novo assembly approach to identify 132k novel indels larger than 10 nucleotides with low false discovery rates. We identify a higher proportion of indels and SVs than previous efforts showing the merits of high coverage and de novo assembly approaches. In addition, we use trio information to identify de novo mutations and use a probabilistic method to provide direct estimates of 1.27e - 8 and 1.5e - 9 per nucleotide per generation for SNVs and indels, respectively.

Dissecting Molecular Evolution in the Highly Diverse Plant Clade Caryophyllales Using Transcriptome Sequencing	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Caryophyllales; substitution rate heterogeneity; paleopolyploidy; RNA-seq	FLOWERING PLANTS; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; EARLY DIVERSIFICATION; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; GENOME DUPLICATIONS; C-4 PHOTOSYNTHESIS; SUBSTITUTION RATES; LIFE-HISTORY; GENE; TREES	Many phylogenomic studies based on transcriptomes have been limited to "single-copy" genes due to methodological challenges in homology and orthology inferences. Only a relatively small number of studies have explored analyses beyond reconstructing species relationships. We sampled 69 transcriptomes in the hyperdiverse plant clade Caryophyllales and 27 outgroups from annotated genomes across eudicots. Using a combined similarity-and phylogenetic tree-based approach, we recovered 10,960 homolog groups, where each was represented by at least eight ingroup taxa. By decomposing these homolog trees, and taking gene duplications into account, we obtained 17,273 ortholog groups, where each was represented by at least ten ingroup taxa. We reconstructed the species phylogeny using a 1,122-gene data set with a gene occupancy of 92.1%. From the homolog trees, we found that both synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates in herbaceous lineages are up to three times as fast as in their woody relatives. This is the first time such a pattern has been shown across thousands of nuclear genes with dense taxon sampling. We also pinpointed regions of the Caryophyllales tree that were characterized by relatively high frequencies of gene duplication, including three previously unrecognized whole-genome duplications. By further combining information from homolog tree topology and synonymous distance between paralog pairs, phylogenetic locations for 13 putative genome duplication events were identified. Genes that experienced the greatest gene family expansion were concentrated among those involved in signal transduction and oxidoreduction, including a cytochrome P450 gene that encodes a key enzyme in the betalain synthesis pathway. Our approach demonstrates a new approach for functional phylogenomic analysis in nonmodel species that is based on homolog groups in addition to inferred ortholog groups.

In -90% of CVID-affected individuals, no genetic cause of the disease has been identified. In a Dutch-Australian CVID-affected family, we identified a NFKB1 heterozygous splice-donor-site mutation (c.730+4A>G), causing in-frame skipping of exon 8. NFKB1 encodes the transcription-factor precursor p105, which is processed to p50 (canonical NF-kappa B pathway). The altered protein bearing an internal deletion (p.Asp191_Lys244delinsGlu; p105 Delta Ex8) is degraded, but is not processed to p50AEx8. Altered NF-kappa B1 proteins were also undetectable in a German CVID-affected family with a heterozygous in-frame exon 9 skipping mutation (c.835+2T>G) and in a CVID-affected family from New Zealand with a heterozygous frameshift mutation (c.465dupA) in exon 7. Given that residual p105 and p50-translated from the non-mutated alleles-were normal, and altered p50 proteins were absent, we conclude that the CVID phenotype in these families is caused by NF-kappa B1 p50 haploinsufficiency.

High-throughput monitoring of wild bee diversity and abundance via mitogenomics	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						agri-environment schemes; biodiversity and ecosystem services; farmland biodiversity; genome skimming; Hymenoptera; metabarcoding; metagenomics; mitogenomes; neonicotinoids; pollination	RIBOSOMAL-RNA; BIODIVERSITY; DNA; POLLINATORS; SENSITIVITY; ALIGNMENT; DECLINES; BRITAIN; READS; SET	1. Bee populations and other pollinators face multiple, synergistically acting threats, which have led to population declines, loss of local species richness and pollination services, and extinctions. However, our understanding of the degree, distribution and causes of declines is patchy, in part due to inadequate monitoring systems, with the challenge of taxonomic identification posing a major logistical barrier. Pollinator conservation would benefit from a high-throughput identification pipeline. 2. We show that the metagenomic mining and resequencing of mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomics) can be applied successfully to bulk samples of wild bees. We assembled the mitogenomes of 48 UK bee species and then shotgun-sequenced total DNA extracted from 204 whole bees that had been collected in 10 pan-trap samples from farms in England and been identified morphologically to 33 species. Each sample data set was mapped against the 48 reference mitogenomes. 3. The morphological and mitogenomic data sets were highly congruent. Out of 63 total species detections in the morphological data set, the mitogenomic data set made 59 correct detections (93.7% detection rate) and detected six more species (putative false positives). Direct inspection and an analysis with species-specific primers suggested that these putative false positives were most likely due to incorrect morphological IDs. Read frequency significantly predicted species biomass frequency (R-2 = 24.9%). Species lists, biomass frequencies, extrapolated species richness and community structure were recovered with less error than in a metabarcoding pipeline. 4. Mitogenomics automates the onerous task of taxonomic identification, even for cryptic species, allowing the tracking of changes in species richness and distributions. A mitogenomic pipeline should thus be able to contain costs, maintain consistently high-quality data over long time series, incorporate retrospective taxonomic revisions and provide an auditable evidence trail. Mitogenomic data sets also provide estimates of species counts within samples and thus have potential for tracking population trajectories.

Three methods are commonly used for WGA: multiple displacement amplification (MDA), degenerate-oligonucleotide-primed PCR (DOP-PCR) and multiple annealing and looping-based amplification cycles (MALBAC). However, a comprehensive comparison of variations detection performance between these WGA methods has not yet been performed. Results: We systematically compared the advantages and disadvantages of different WGA methods, focusing particularly on variations detection. Low-coverage whole-genome sequencing revealed that DOP-PCR had the highest duplication ratio, but an even read distribution and the best reproducibility and accuracy for detection of copy-number variations (CNVs). However, MDA had significantly higher genome recovery sensitivity (similar to 84 %) than DOP-PCR (similar to 6 %) and MALBAC (similar to 52 %) at high sequencing depth. MALBAC and MDA had comparable single-nucleotide variations detection efficiency, false-positive ratio, and allele drop-out ratio. We further demonstrated that SCRS data amplified by either MDA or MALBAC from a gastric cancer cell line could accurately detect gastric cancer CNVs with comparable sensitivity and specificity, including amplifications of 12p11.22 (KRAS) and 9p24.1 (JAK2, CD274, and PDCD1LG2). Conclusions: Our findings provide a comprehensive comparison of variations detection performance using SCRS amplified by different WGA methods. It will guide researchers to determine which WGA method is best suited to individual experimental needs at single-cell level.

Despite their functional significance, phytochrome diversity and evolution across photosynthetic eukaryotes remain poorly understood. Using newly available transcriptomic and genomic data we show that canonical plant phytochromes originated in a common ancestor of streptophytes (charophyte algae and land plants). Phytochromes in charophyte algae are structurally diverse, including canonical and non-canonical forms, whereas in land plants, phytochrome structure is highly conserved. Liverworts, hornworts and Selaginella apparently possess a single phytochrome, whereas independent gene duplications occurred within mosses, lycopods, ferns and seed plants, leading to diverse phytochrome families in these clades. Surprisingly, the phytochrome portions of algal and land plant neochromes, a chimera of phytochrome and phototropin, appear to share a common origin. Our results reveal novel phytochrome clades and establish the basis for understanding phytochrome functional evolution in land plants and their algal relatives.

Since RNA-seq provides a powerful tool for transcriptome-based applications beyond the limitations of microarrays, we sought to systematically evaluate the performance of RNA-seq-based and microarray-based classifiers in this MAQC-III/SEQC study for clinical endpoint prediction using neuroblastoma as a model. Results: We generate gene expression profiles from 498 primary neuroblastomas using both RNA-seq and 44 k microarrays. Characterization of the neuroblastoma transcriptome by RNA-seq reveals that more than 48,000 genes and 200,000 transcripts are being expressed in this malignancy. We also find that RNA-seq provides much more detailed information on specific transcript expression patterns in clinico-genetic neuroblastoma subgroups than microarrays. To systematically compare the power of RNA-seq and microarray-based models in predicting clinical endpoints, we divide the cohort randomly into training and validation sets and develop 360 predictive models on six clinical endpoints of varying predictability. Evaluation of factors potentially affecting model performances reveals that prediction accuracies are most strongly influenced by the nature of the clinical endpoint, whereas technological platforms (RNA-seq vs. microarrays), RNA-seq data analysis pipelines, and feature levels (gene vs. transcript vs. exon-junction level) do not significantly affect performances of the models. Conclusions: We demonstrate that RNA-seq outperforms microarrays in determining the transcriptomic characteristics of cancer, while RNA-seq and microarray-based models perform similarly in clinical endpoint prediction. Our findings may be valuable to guide future studies on the development of gene expression-based predictive models and their implementation in clinical practice.

Here, we report the first de novo assembled 1.35 Gb genome sequences for D. officinale by combining the second-generation Illumina Hiseq 2000 and third-generation PacBio sequencing technologies. We found that orchids have a complete inflorescence gene set and have some specific inflorescence genes. We observed gene expansion in gene families related to fungus symbiosis and drought resistance. We analyzed biosynthesis pathways of medicinal components of D. officinale and found extensive duplication of SPS and SuSy genes, which are related to polysaccharide generation, and that the pathway of D. officinale alkaloid synthesis could be extended to generate 16-epivellosimine. The D. officinale genome assembly demonstrates a new approach to deciphering large complex genomes and, as an important orchid species and a traditional Chinese medicine, the D. officinale genome will facilitate future research on the evolution of orchid plants, as well as the study of medicinal components and potential genetic breeding of the dendrobe.

Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the primary molecular markers used for genetic map construction. In this study, we identified 13,362 SNPs evenly distributed across the Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) genome. Of these SNPs, 12,712 high-confidence SNPs were subjected to high-throughput genotyping and assigned to 24 consensus linkage groups (LGs). The total length of the genetic linkage map was 3,497.29 cM with an average distance of 0.47 cM between loci, thereby representing the densest genetic map currently reported for Japanese flounder. Nine positive quantitative trait loci (QTLs) forming two main clusters for Vibrio anguillarum disease resistance were detected. All QTLs could explain 5.1-8.38% of the total phenotypic variation. Synteny analysis of the QTL regions on the genome assembly revealed 12 immune-related genes, among them 4 genes strongly associated with V. anguillarum disease resistance. In addition, 246 genome assembly scaffolds with an average size of 21.79 Mb were anchored onto the LGs; these scaffolds, comprising 522.99 Mb, represented 95.78% of assembled genomic sequences. The mapped assembly scaffolds in Japanese flounder were used for genome synteny analyses against zebrafish (Danio rerio) and medaka (Oryzias latipes). Flounder and medaka were found to possess almost one-to-one synteny, whereas flounder and zebrafish exhibited a multi-syntenic correspondence. The newly developed high-resolution genetic map, which will facilitate QTL mapping, scaffold assembly, and genome synteny analysis of Japanese flounder, marks a milestone in the ongoing genome project for this species.

Recently, in vitro evidence from several groups has shown that the sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP, which is encoded by SLC10A1 and transports bile acids into hepatic cells in enterohepatic recirculation) is a strong candidate. In particular, in vitro the p.Ser267Phe variation of SLC10A1 results in loss of HBV receptor function. We tested the role of NTCP as a receptor for HBV in chronic hepatitis B patients using a genetic association study. We selected SLC10A1 variants from 189 exomes. We used Sanger sequencing to follow up the association of the various SLC10A1 variants in a Han Chinese cohort of 1899 chronic hepatitis B patients and 1828 healthy controls. We further investigated the potential impact of the p.Ser267Phe variant on NTCP function using structural analysis. The p.Ser267Phe variant was associated with healthy status (P=5.7 x 10(,)(-23) odds ratio=0.36) irrespective of hepatitis B virus surface antibody status (P=6.2 x 10(-21) and 1.5 x 10(-10), respectively, when the cases were compared with hepatitis B virus surface antibody-positive and -negative controls). The variation was also associated with a lower incidence of acute-on-chronic liver failure (P=0.007). The estimated heritability explained by this single variation was approximate to 3.2%. The population prevented fraction was around 13.0% among the southern Chinese. Our structural modeling showed that the p.Ser267Phe variant might interfere with ligand binding, thereby preventing HBV from cellular entry. Conclusion: The p.Ser267Phe NTCP variant is significantly associated with resistance to chronic hepatitis B and a lower incidence of acute-on-chronic liver failure. Our results support that NTCP is a cellular receptor for HBV in human infection.

Objective: We sought to identify novel mutations in TNFRSF7/CD27 and to provide an overview of clinical, immunologic, and laboratory phenotypes in patients with CD27 deficiency. Methods: Review of the medical records and molecular, genetic, and flow cytometric analyses of the patients and family members were performed. Treatment outcomes of previously described patients were followed up. Results: In addition to the previously reported homozygous mutations c.G24A/p.W8X (n = 2) and c.G158A/p.C53Y (n = 8), 4 novel mutations were identified: homozygous missense c.G287A/p.C96Y (n = 4), homozygous missense c.C232T/p.R78W (n = 1), heterozygous nonsense c.C30A/p.C10X (n = 1), and compound heterozygous c.C319T/p.R107C-c.G24A/p. W8X (n = 1). EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disease/hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, Hodgkin lymphoma, uveitis, and recurrent infections were the predominant clinical features. Expression of cell-surface and solubleCD27 was significantly reduced in patients and heterozygous family members. Immunoglobulin substitution therapy was administered in 5 of the newly diagnosed cases. Conclusion: CD27 deficiency is potentially fatal and should be excluded in all cases of severe EBV infections to minimize diagnostic delay. Flow cytometric immunophenotyping offers a reliable initial test for CD27 deficiency. Determining the precise role of CD27 in immunity against EBV might provide a framework for new therapeutic concepts.

This same principle applies to the rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae and the rice host; however, genetic variations among different isolates of M. oryzae remain largely unknown, particularly at genome and transcriptome levels. Here, we applied genomic and transcriptomic analytical tools to investigate M. oryzae isolate 98-06 that is the most aggressive in infection of susceptible rice cultivars. A unique 1.4 Mb of genomic sequences was found in isolate 98-06 in comparison to reference strain 70-15. Genome-wide expression profiling revealed the presence of two critical expression patterns of M. oryzae based on 64 known pathogenicity-related (PaR) genes. In addition, 134 candidate effectors with various segregation patterns were identified. Five tested proteins could suppress BAX-mediated programmed cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Characterization of isolate-specific effector candidates Iug6 and Iug9 and PaR candidate Iug18 revealed that they have a role in fungal propagation and pathogenicity. Moreover, Iug6 and Iug9 are located exclusively in the biotrophic interfacial complex (BIC) and their overexpression leads to suppression of defense-related gene expression in rice, suggesting that they might participate in biotrophy by inhibiting the SA and ET pathways within the host. Thus, our studies identify novel effector and PaR proteins involved in pathogenicity of the highly aggressive M. oryzae field isolate 98-06, and reveal molecular and genomic dynamics in the evolution of M. oryzae and rice host interactions.

The diploid nature and adaptation to diverse environments of the highland give it unique resources for genetic research and crop improvement. Here we produced a 3.89-Gb draft assembly of Tibetan hulless barley with 36,151 predicted protein-coding genes. Comparative analyses revealed the divergence times and synteny between barley and other representative Poaceae genomes. The expansion of the gene family related to stress responses was found in Tibetan hulless barley. Resequencing of 10 barley accessions uncovered high levels of genetic variation in Tibetan wild barley and genetic divergence between Tibetan and non-Tibetan barley genomes. Selective sweep analyses demonstrate adaptive correlations of genes under selection with extensive environmental variables. Our results not only construct a genomic framework for crop improvement but also provide evolutionary insights of highland adaptation of Tibetan hulless barley.

A comparison of isolated circulating tumor cells and tissue biopsies using whole-genome sequencing in prostate cancer	ONCOTARGET			English	Article						circulating tumor cell; prostate cancer; whole genome sequencing; liquid biopsy; cancer heterogeneity	METASTATIC BREAST-CANCER; COPY-NUMBER; LUNG-CANCER; SINGLE-NUCLEOTIDE; PERIPHERAL-BLOOD; PD-1 BLOCKADE; MUTATIONS; EVOLUTION; DNA; REARRANGEMENTS	Previous studies have demonstrated focal but limited molecular similarities between circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and biopsies using isolated genetic assays. We hypothesized that molecular similarity between CTCs and tissue exists at the single cell level when characterized by whole genome sequencing (WGS). By combining the NanoVelcro CTC Chip with laser capture microdissection (LCM), we developed a platform for single-CTC WGS. We performed this procedure on CTCs and tissue samples from a patient with advanced prostate cancer who had serial biopsies over the course of his clinical history. We achieved 30X depth and >= 95% coverage. Twenty-nine percent of the somatic single nucleotide variations (SSNVs) identified were founder mutations that were also identified in CTCs. In addition, 86% of the clonal mutations identified in CTCs could be traced back to either the primary or metastatic tumors. In this patient, we identified structural variations (SVs) including an intrachromosomal rearrangement in chr3 and an interchromosomal rearrangement between chr13 and chr15. These rearrangements were shared between tumor tissues and CTCs. At the same time, highly heterogeneous short structural variants were discovered in PTEN, RB1, and BRCA2 in all tumor and CTC samples. Using high-quality WGS on single-CTCs, we identified the shared genomic alterations between CTCs and tumor tissues. This approach yielded insight into the heterogeneity of the mutational landscape of SSNVs and SVs. It may be possible to use this approach to study heterogeneity and characterize the biological evolution of a cancer during the course of its natural history.

Lineage-specific gene radiations underlie the evolution of novel betalain pigmentation in Caryophyllales	NEW PHYTOLOGIST			English	Article						anthocyanin; betalains; Caryophyllales; lineage-specific genes; pigmentation; taxonomically restricted genes	PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; MIRABILIS-JALAPA; GENOME; PLANTS; BIOSYNTHESIS; ANTIOXIDANT; ALIGNMENTS; VULGARIS; FAMILY	Betalain pigments are unique to the Caryophyllales and structurally and biosynthetically distinct from anthocyanins. Two key enzymes within the betalain synthesis pathway have been identified: 4,5-dioxygenase (DODA) that catalyzes the formation of betalamic acid and CYP76AD1, a cytochrome P450 gene that catalyzes the formation of cyclo-DOPA. We performed phylogenetic analyses to reveal the evolutionary history of the DODA and CYP76AD1 lineages and in the context of an ancestral reconstruction of pigment states we explored the evolution of these genes in relation to the complex evolution of pigments in Caryophylalles. Duplications within the CYP76AD1 and DODA lineages arose just before the origin of betalain pigmentation in the core Caryophyllales. The duplications gave rise to DODA- and CYP76AD1- isoforms that appear specific to betalain synthesis. Both betalain-specific isoforms were then lost or downregulated in the anthocyanic Molluginaceae and Caryophyllaceae. Our findings suggest a single origin of the betalain synthesis pathway, with neofunctionalization following gene duplications in the CYP76AD1 and DODA lineages. Loss of DODA- and CYP76AD1- in anthocyanic taxa suggests that betalain pigmentation has been lost twice in Caryophyllales, and exclusion of betalain pigments from anthocyanic taxa is mediated through gene loss or downregulation. [Correction added after online publication 13 May 2015: in the last two paragraphs of the Summary the gene name CYP761A was changed to CYP76AD1.]	[Brockington, Samuel F.; Covshoff, Sarah; Hibberd, Julian M.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Plant Sci, Cambridge CB2 3EA, England; [Yang, Ya; Smith, Stephen A.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Gandia-Herrero, Fernando] Univ Murcia, Fac Vet, Dept Bioquim & Biol Mol A, Unidad Docente Biol,Reg Campus Int Excellence Cam, E-30100 Murcia, Spain; [Sage, Rowan F.] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada; [Wong, Gane K.

Genetic analysis indicates that its six internal genes all originated from H9N2 viruses. However, the H7N9 virus is more highly pathogenic in humans than H9N2, which suggests that the internal genes of H7N9 have mutated. To analyze which H7N9 virus internal genes contribute to its high pathogenicity, a series of reassortants was generated by reverse genetics, with each virus containing a single internal gene of the typical A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) (AH-H7N9) virus in the genetic background of the A/chicken/Shandong/lx1023/2007 (H9N2) virus. The replication ability, polymerase activity, and pathogenicity of these viruses were then evaluated in vitro and in vivo. These recombinants displayed high genetic compatibility, and the H7N9-derived PB2, M, and NP genes were identified as the virulence genes for the reassortants in mice. Further investigation confirmed that the PB2 K627 residue is critical for the high pathogenicity of the H7N9 virus and the reassortant containing the H7N9-derived PB2 segment (H9N2-AH/PB2). Notably, the H7N9-derived PB2 gene displayed greater compatibility with the H9N2 genome than that of H7N9, endowing the H9N2-AH/PB2 reassortant with greater viability and virulence than the parental H7N9 virus. In addition, the H7N9 virus, with the exception of the H9N2 reassortants, could effectively replicate in human A549 cells. Our results indicate that PB2, M, and NP are the key virulence genes, together with the surface hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins, contributing to the high infectivity of the H7N9 virus in humans. IMPORTANCE To date, the novel H7N9 influenza A virus has caused 437 human infections, with approximately 30% mortality. Previous work has primarily focused on the two viral surface proteins, HA and NA, but the contribution of the six internal genes to the high pathogenicity of H7N9 has not been systematically studied. Here, the H9N2 virus was used as a genetic backbone to evaluate the virulence genes of H7N9 virus in vitro and in vivo. Our data indicate that the PB2, M, and NP genes play important roles in viral infection in mice and, together with HA and NA, contribute to the high infectivity of the H7N9 virus in humans.

We analyzed 214 mutations across 26 lung cancer-associated genes and three fusion genes using the MassARRAY (R) LungCarta Panel and the ALK, ROS1, and RET fusion assays in 198 consecutively resected lung adenocarcinomas from never-smoker females at a single institution. EGFR mutation, which was the most frequent driver gene mutation, was detected in 124 ( 63%) cases. Mutation of ALK, KRAS, PIK3CA, ERBB2, BRAF, ROS1, and RET genesoccurred in 7%, 4%, 2.5%, 1.5%, 1%, 1%, and 1% of cases, respectively. Thus, 79% of lung adenocarcinomas from never-smoker females harbored well-known oncogenic mutations. Mucinous adenocarcinomas tended to have a lower frequency of known driver gene mutations than other histologic subtypes. EGFR mutation was associated with older age and a predominantly acinar pattern, while ALK rearrangement was associated with younger age and a predominantly solid pattern. Lung cancer in never-smoker Asian females is a distinct entity, with the majority of these cancers developing from oncogenic mutations.

Whole genome sequencing and the development of genetic maps of these species are important components in molecular breeding and genetic improvement. Here we report the draft genome of physic nut (Jatropha curcas L.), a biodiesel plant. The assembled genome has a total length of 320.5Mbp and contains 27172 putative protein-coding genes. We established a linkage map containing 1208 markers and anchored the genome assembly (81.7%) to this map to produce 11 pseudochromosomes. After gene family clustering, 15268 families were identified, of which 13887 existed in the castor bean genome. Analysis of the genome highlighted specific expansion and contraction of a number of gene families during the evolution of this species, including the ribosome-inactivating proteins and oil biosynthesis pathway enzymes. The genomic sequence and linkage map provide a valuable resource not only for fundamental and applied research on physic nut but also for evolutionary and comparative genomics analysis, particularly in the Euphorbiaceae. Significance StatementThe genomic sequence and linkage map of physic nut provide a valuable resource not only for the fundamental and applied research on physic nut but also for evolutionary and comparative genomics analysis, particularly in the Euphorbiaceae.

Genetic blueprint of the zoonotic pathogen Toxocara canis	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES; HAEMONCHUS-CONTORTUS; CAENORHABDITIS-ELEGANS; GLOBAL IMPORTANCE; INFECTIVE LARVAE; NETWORK ANALYSIS; DRAFT GENOME; EXPRESSION; ASCARIS; IDENTIFICATION	Toxocara canis is a zoonotic parasite of major socioeconomic importance worldwide. In humans, this nematode causes disease (toxocariasis) mainly in the under-privileged communities in developed and developing countries. Although relatively well studied from clinical and epidemiological perspectives, to date, there has been no global investigation of the molecular biology of this parasite. Here we use next-generation sequencing to produce a draft genome and transcriptome of T. canis to support future biological and biotechnological investigations. This genome is 317Mb in size, has a repeat content of 13.5% and encodes at least 18,596 protein-coding genes. We study transcription in a larval, as well as adult female and male stages, characterize the parasite's gene-silencing machinery, explore molecules involved in development or host-parasite interactions and predict intervention targets. The draft genome of T. canis should provide a useful resource for future molecular studies of this and other, related parasites.

Furthermore, visualization of clustering results is crucial to uncover the structure of biological networks. In this paper, ClusterViz, an APP of Cytoscape 3 for cluster analysis and visualization, has been developed. In order to reduce complexity and enable extendibility for ClusterViz, we designed the architecture of ClusterViz based on the framework of Open Services Gateway Initiative. According to the architecture, the implementation of ClusterViz is partitioned into three modules including interface of ClusterViz, clustering algorithms and visualization and export. ClusterViz fascinates the comparison of the results of different algorithms to do further related analysis. Three commonly used clustering algorithms, FAG-EC, EAGLE and MCODE, are included in the current version. Due to adopting the abstract interface of algorithms in module of the clustering algorithms, more clustering algorithms can be included for the future use. To illustrate usability of ClusterViz, we provided three examples with detailed steps from the important scientific articles, which show that our tool has helped several research teams do their research work on the mechanism of the biological networks.

Here, we assembled a de novo genome of a Tibetan chicken and resequenced whole genomes of 32 additional chickens, including Tibetan chickens, village chickens, game fowl, and Red Junglefowl, and found that the Tibetan chickens could broadly be placed into two groups. Further analyses revealed that several candidate genes in the calcium-signaling pathway are possibly involved in adaptation to the hypoxia experienced by these chickens, as these genes appear to have experienced directional selection in the two Tibetan chicken populations, suggesting a potential genetic mechanism underlying high altitude adaptation in Tibetan chickens. The candidate selected genes identified in this study, and their variants, may be useful targets for clarifying our understanding of the domestication of chickens in Tibet, and might be useful in current breeding efforts to develop improved breeds for the highlands.

Geese are capable of rapid growth, disease resistance, and high liver lipid storage capacity, and can be easily fed coarse fodder. Here, we sequence and analyze the whole-genome sequence of an economically important goose breed in China and compare it with that of terrestrial bird species. Results: A draft sequence of the whole-goose genome was obtained by shotgun sequencing, and 16,150 protein-coding genes were predicted. Comparative genomics indicate that significant differences occur between the goose genome and that of other terrestrial bird species, particularly regarding major histocompatibility complex, Myxovirus resistance, Retinoic acid-inducible gene I, and other genes related to disease resistance in geese. In addition, analysis of transcriptome data further reveals a potential molecular mechanism involved in the susceptibility of geese to fatty liver disease and its associated symptoms, including high levels of unsaturated fatty acids and low levels of cholesterol. The results of this study show that deletion of the goose lep gene might be the result of positive selection, thus allowing the liver to adopt energy storage mechanisms for long-distance migration. Conclusions: This is the first report describing the complete goose genome sequence and contributes to genomic resources available for studying aquatic birds.

Elective SET coupled with enhanced embryo selection using PGS in women older than 35 years reduced the multiple pregnancy rates while maintaining the cumulative success rate of the IVF programme. Multiple pregnancies mean an increased risk of premature birth and perinatal death and occur mainly in older patients when multiple embryos are transferred to increase the chance of pregnancy. A SET policy is usually recommended in cases of good prognosis patients, but no general consensus has been reached for SET application in the advanced maternal age (AMA) population, defined as women older than 35 years. Our objective was to evaluate the results in terms of efficacy, efficiency and safety of an eSET policy coupled with increased application of blastocyst culture and PGS for this population of patients in our IVF programme. In January 2013, a multidisciplinary intervention involving optimization of embryo selection procedure and introduction of an eSET policy in an AMA population of women was implemented. This is a retrospective 4-year (January 2010-December 2013) pre- and post-intervention analysis, including 1161 and 499 patients in the pre- and post-intervention period, respectively. The primary outcome measures were the cumulative delivery rate (DR) per oocyte retrieval cycle and multiple DR. Surplus oocytes and/or embryos were vitrified during the entire study period. In the post-intervention period, all couples with good quality embryos and less than two previous implantation failures were offered eSET. Embryo selection was enhanced by blastocyst culture and PGS (blastocyst stage biopsy and 24-chromosomal screening). Elective SET was also applied in cryopreservation cycles. Patient and cycle characteristics were similar in the pre- and post-intervention groups [mean (SD) female age: 39.6 +/- 2.1 and 39.4 +/- 2.2 years; range 36-44] as assessed by logistic regression. A total of 1609 versus 574 oocyte retrievals, 937 versus 350 embryo warming and 138 versus 27 oocyte warming cycles were performed in the pre- and post-intervention periods, respectively, resulting in 1854 and 508 embryo transfers, respectively. In the post-intervention period, 289 cycles were blastocyst stage with (n = 182) or without PGS (n = 107). A mean (SD) number of 2.9 +/- 1.1 (range 1-4) and 1.4 +/- 0.8 (range 1-3) embryos were transferred pre- and post-intervention, respectively (P < 0.01) and similar cumulative clinical pregnancy rates per transfer and per cycle were obtained: 26.8, 30.9% and 29.7, 26.3%, respectively. The total DR per oocyte retrieval cycle (21.0 and 20.4% pre- and post-intervention, respectively) defined as efficacy was not affected by the intervention [odds ratio (OR) = 0.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.7-1.1; P = 0.23]. However, a significantly increased live birth rate per transferred embryo (defined as efficiency) was observed in the post-intervention group 17.0 versus 10.6% (P < 0.01). Multiple DRs decreased from 21.0 in the preintervention to 6.8% in the post-intervention group (OR = 0.3. 95% CI = 0.1-0.7; P < 0.01). In this study, the suitability of SET was assessed in individual women on the basis of both clinical and embryological prognostic factors and was not standardized. For the described eSET strategy coupled with an enhanced embryo selection policy, an optimized culture system, cryopreservation and aneuploidy screening programme is necessary. Owing to the increased maternal morbidity and perinatal complications related to multiple pregnancies, it is recommended to extend the eSET policy to the AMA population. As shown in this study, enhanced embryo selection procedures might allow a reduction in the number of embryos transferred and the number of transfers to be performed without affecting the total efficacy of the treatment but increasing efficiency and safety.

During unfavorable glacial periods, many species experienced range contraction and fragmentation, expanding again during interglacials [2- 4]. An understanding of the evolutionary consequences of both historical and ongoing climate changes requires knowledge of the temporal dynamics of population numbers during such climate cycles. Variation in abundance should have left clear signatures in the patterns of intraspecific genetic variation in extant species, from which historical effective population sizes (Ne) can be estimated [3]. We analyzed whole-genome sequences of 38 avian species in a pairwise sequentially Markovian coalescent (PSMC, [5]) framework to quantitatively reveal changes in Ne from approximately 10 million to 10 thousand years ago. Significant fluctuations in Ne over time were evident for most species. The most pronounced pattern observed in many species was a severe reduction in Ne coinciding with the beginning of the last glacial period (LGP). Among species, Ne varied by at least three orders of magnitude, exceeding 1 million in the most abundant species. Several species on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species showed long-term reduction in population size, predating recent declines. We conclude that cycles of population expansions and contractions have been a common feature of many bird species during the Quaternary period, likely coinciding with climate cycles. Population size reduction should have increased the risk of extinction but may also have promoted speciation. Species that have experienced long-term declines may be especially vulnerable to recent anthropogenic threats.

Techniques are categorized as either 'open' or 'closed' according to occurrence of direct contact between the medium and liquid nitrogen during cryopreservation. Advocates of closed systems emphasize the potential danger of disease transmission mediated through liquid nitrogen, and praise the safety of their approach; those who use the open systems refer to the lack of evidence of disease transmission and regard their systems as more consistent and efficient. The purpose of this review is to clarify whether open and closed systems are really open and closed; if closed systems are safe and free of any danger of contamination; if closed systems are equally efficient as open ones for cryopreservation of human embryos and oocytes by considering overall outcome; and finally, if ethical and legal concerns are sound when risks and benefits are considered in a broader sense. On the basis of these answers, implementation of rational measures to lower the theoretical danger of disease transmission are proposed while maintaining the achievements in cryopreservation that have contributed substantially to the advancement in assisted reproduction techniques during the past decade.

Here we report the assembly of a haplotype-resolved diploid genome without using a reference genome. Our pipeline relies on fosmid pooling together with whole-genome shotgun strategies, based solely on next-generation sequencing and hierarchical assembly methods. We applied our sequencing method to the genome of an Asian individual and generated a 5.15-Gb assembled genome with a haplotype N50 of 484 kb. Our analysis identified previously undetected indels and 7.49 Mb of novel coding sequences that could not be aligned to the human reference genome, which include at least six predicted genes. This haplotype-resolved genome represents the most complete de novo human genome assembly to date. Application of our approach to identify individual haplotype differences should aid in translating genotypes to phenotypes for the development of personalized medicine.

Transcriptome profiling of brown adipose tissue during cold exposure reveals extensive regulation of glucose metabolism	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-ENDOCRINOLOGY AND METABOLISM			English	Article						thermogenesis; glycolysis; pyruvate dehydrogenase	FATTY-ACID CYCLE; GENE-EXPRESSION; IN-VIVO; ADIPOCYTE DIFFERENTIATION; ADULT HUMANS; WHITE FAT; THERMOGENESIS; MOUSE; RAT; ACTIVATION	We applied digital gene expression profiling to determine the transcriptome of brown and white adipose tissues (BAT and WAT, respectively) during cold exposure. Male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to cold for 2 or 4 days. A notable induction of genes related to glucose uptake, glycolysis, glycogen metabolism, and the pentose phosphate pathway was observed in BAT from cold-exposed animals. In addition, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1 expression was induced in BAT from cold-challenged mice, suggesting increased synthesis of glycerol from glucose. Similarly, expression of lactate dehydrogenases was induced by cold in BAT. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2 (Pdk2) and Pdk4 were expressed at significantly higher levels in BAT than in WAT, and Pdk2 was induced in BAT by cold. Of notice, only a subset of the changes detected in BAT was observed in WAT. Based on changes in gene expression during cold exposure, we propose a model for the intermediary glucose metabolism in activated BAT: 1) fluxes through glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway are induced, the latter providing reducing equivalents for de novo fatty acid synthesis; 2) glycerol synthesis from glucose is increased, facilitating triacylglycerol synthesis/fatty acid re-esterification; 3) glycogen turnover and lactate production are increased; and 4) entry of glucose carbon into the tricarboxylic acid cycle is restricted by PDK2 and PDK4. In summary, our results demonstrate extensive and diverse gene expression changes related to glucose handling in activated BAT.

The growing global population and shrinking arable land area require efficient plant breeding. Novel strategies assisted by certain markers have proven effective for genetic gains. Fortunately, cutting-edge sequencing technologies bring us a deluge of genomes and genetic variations, enlightening the potential of marker development. However, a large gap still exists between the potential of molecular markers and actual plant breeding practices. In this review, we discuss marker-assisted breeding from a historical perspective, describe the road from crop sequencing to breeding, and highlight how sequencing facilitates the application of markers in breeding practice.

Peptidomics of Circular Cysteine-Rich Plant Peptides: Analysis of the Diversity of Cyclotides from Viola tricolor by Transcriptome and Proteome Mining	JOURNAL OF PROTEOME RESEARCH			English	Article						circular peptides; cystine-knot; transcriptome; peptidomics; Violaceae; ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides; natural products; mass spectrometry; 1kp	CYCLIC CYSTINE-KNOT; OLDENLANDIA-AFFINIS; CYCLOVIOLACIN O2; CYTOTOXIC CYCLOTIDES; MACROCYCLIC PEPTIDES; HYBANTHUS VIOLACEAE; FLOWERING PLANTS; KALATA B1; DISCOVERY; PROTEINS	Cyclotides are plant-derived mini proteins. They are genetically encoded as precursor proteins that become post-translationally modified to yield circular cystine-knotted molecules. Because of this structural topology cydotides resist enzymatic degradation in biological fluids, and hence they are considered as promising lead molecules for pharmaceutical applications. Despite ongoing efforts to discover novel cydotides and analyze their biodiversity, it is not clear how many individual peptides a single plant specimen can express. Therefore, we investigated the transcriptome and c-ydotide peptidome of Viola tricolor. Transcriptome mining enabled the characterization of cydotide precursor architecture and processing sites important for biosynthesis of mature peptides. The cydotide peptidome was explored by mass spectrometry and bottom-up proteomics using the extracted peptide sequences as queries for database searching. In total 164 cydotides were discovered by nucleic acid and peptide analysis in V. tricolor. Therefore, violaceous plants at a global scale may be the source to as many as 150 000 individual cydotides. Encompassing the diversity of V. tricolor as a combinatorial library of bioactive peptides, this commercially available medicinal herb may be a suitable starting point for future bioactivity-guided screening studies.

Recurrent Loss of Sex Is Associated with Accumulation of Deleterious Mutations in Oenothera	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						evolution of sex; deleterious mutations; asexual reproduction; purifying selection; Muller's ratchet	ADAPTIVE MOLECULAR EVOLUTION; FRESH-WATER SNAIL; EVENING PRIMROSES; RECOMBINATION; SEGREGATION; POPULATIONS; LINEAGES; DIPLOIDS; BIOLOGY; GENE	Sexual reproduction is nearly universal among eukaryotes. Theory predicts that the rarity of asexual eukaryotic species is in part caused by accumulation of deleterious mutations and heightened extinction risk associated with suppressed recombination and segregation in asexual species. We tested this prediction with a large data set of 62 transcriptomes from 29 species in the plant genus Oenothera, spanning ten independent transitions between sexual and a functionally asexual genetic system called permanent translocation heterozygosity. Illumina short-read sequencing and de novo transcript assembly yielded an average of 16.4 Mb of sequence per individual. Here, we show that functionally asexual species accumulate more deleterious mutations than sexual species using both population genomic and phylogenetic analysis. At an individual level, asexual species exhibited 1.8x higher heterozygosity than sexual species. Within species, we detected a higher proportion of nonsynonymous polymorphism relative to synonymous variation within asexual compared with sexual species, indicating reduced efficacy of purifying selection. Asexual species also exhibited a greater proportion of transcripts with premature stop codons. The increased proportion of nonsynonymous mutations was also positively correlated with divergence time between sexual and asexual species, consistent with Muller's ratchet. Between species, we detected repeated increases in the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous divergence in asexual species compared with sexually reproducing sister taxa, indicating increased accumulation of deleterious mutations. These results confirm that an important advantage of sex is that it facilitates selection against deleterious alleles, which might help to explain the dearth of extant asexual species.

Mutations in five genes, encoding subunits of the cohesin complex (SMC1A, SMC3, RAD21) and its regulators (NIPBL, HDAC8), account for at least 70% of patients with CdLS or CdLS-like phenotypes. To date, only the clinical features from a single CdLS patient with SMC3 mutation has been published. Here, we report the efforts of an international research and clinical collaboration to provide clinical comparison of 16 patients with CdLS-like features caused by mutations in SMC3. Modeling of the mutation effects on protein structure suggests a dominant-negative effect on the multimeric cohesin complex. When compared with typical CdLS, many SMC3-associated phenotypes are also characterized by postnatal microcephaly but with a less distinctive craniofacial appearance, a milder prenatal growth retardation that worsens in childhood, few congenital heart defects, and an absence of limb deficiencies. While most mutations are unique, two unrelated affected individuals shared the same mutation but presented with different phenotypes. This work confirms that de novo SMC3 mutations account for approximate to 1%-2% of CdLS-like phenotypes.

These body fluids include urine; however, the relationship between, specifically, urinary metabolic phenotypes and PD is not fully understood. In this study, urinary metabolites from a total of 401 clinical urine samples collected from 106 idiopathic PD patients and 104 normal control subjects were profiled by using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry. Our study revealed significant correlation between clinical phenotype and urinary metabolite profile. Metabolic profiles of idiopathic PD patients differed significantly and consistently from normal controls, with related metabolic pathway variations observed in steroidogenesis, fatty acid beta-oxidation, histidine metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, and tyrosine metabolism. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the alteration of the kynurenine pathway in tryptophan metabolism corresponded with pathogenic changes in the alpha-synuclein overexpressed Drosophila model of PD. The results suggest that LC-MS-based urinary metabolomic profiling can reveal the metabolite signatures and related variations in metabolic pathways that characterize PD. Consistent PD-related changes across species may provide the basis for understanding metabolic regulation of PD at the molecular level.

However, an efficient and accurate analytical tool is still on demand to process the huge amount of data. We have developed a high-resolution analytical pipeline, Immune Monitor (IMonitor) to tackle this task. This method utilizes realignment to identify V(D)J genes and alleles after common local alignment. We compare IMonitor with other published tools by simulated and public rearranged sequences, and it demonstrates its superior performance in most aspects. Together with this, a methodology is developed to correct the PCR and sequencing errors and to minimize the PCR bias among various rearranged sequences with different V and J gene families. IMonitor provides general adaptation for sequences from all receptor chains of different species and outputs useful statistics and visualizations. In the final part of this article, we demonstrate its application on minimal residual disease detection in patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In summary, this package would be of widespread usage for immune repertoire analysis.

We proposed that proteogenomics of testis tissue was a feasible approach to identify more MPs because testis tissues have higher gene expression levels. Here we combined proteomics and transcriptomics to survey gene expression in human testis tissues from three post-mortem individuals. Proteins were extracted and separated with glycine- and tricine-SDS-PAGE. A total of 9597 protein groups were identified; of these, 166 protein groups were listed as MPs, including 138 groups (83.1%) with transcriptional evidence. A total of 2948 proteins are designated as MPs, and 5.6% of these were identified in this study. The high incidence of MPs in testis tissue indicates that this is a rich resource for MPs. Functional category analysis revealed that the biological processes that testis MPs are mainly involved in are sexual reproduction and spermatogenesis. Some of the MPs are potentially involved in tumorgenesis in other tissues. Therefore, this proteogenomics analysis of individual testis tissues provides convincing evidence of the discovery of MPs. All mass spectrometry data from this study have been deposited in the ProteomeXchange (data set identifier PXD002179).

However, ndh genes are truncated or deleted in some autotrophic Epidendroideae orchid cp genomes. To determine the evolutionary timing of the gene deletions and the genomic locations of the various ndh genes in orchids, the cp genomes of Vanilla planifolia, Paphiopedilum armeniacum, Paphiopedilum niveum, Cypripedium formosanum, Habenaria longidenticulata, Goodyera fumata and Masdevallia picturata were sequenced; these genomes represent Vanilloideae, Cypripedioideae, Orchidoideae and Epidendroideae subfamilies. Four orchid cp genome sequences were found to contain a complete set of ndh genes. In other genomes, ndh deletions did not correlate to known taxonomic or evolutionary relationships and deletions occurred independently after the orchid family split into different subfamilies. In orchids lacking cp encoded ndh genes, non cp localized ndh sequences were identified. In Erycina pusilla, at least 10 truncated ndh gene fragments were found transferred to the mitochondrial (mt) genome. The phenomenon of orchid ndh transfer to the mt genome existed in ndh-deleted orchids and also in ndh containing species.

Genomic legacy of the African cheetah, Acinonyx jubatus	GENOME BIOLOGY			English	Article						Genetic diversity; Conservation biology; Population biology	MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; DOMESTIC CAT; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; GENETIC-VARIATION; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; POSITIVE SELECTION; SATELLITE DNA; ASIATIC LIONS; EVOLUTION; DATABASE	Background: Patterns of genetic and genomic variance are informative in inferring population history for human, model species and endangered populations. Results: Here the genome sequence of wild-born African cheetahs reveals extreme genomic depletion in SNV incidence, SNV density, SNVs of coding genes, MHC class I and II genes, and mitochondrial DNA SNVs. Cheetah genomes are on average 95 % homozygous compared to the genomes of the outbred domestic cat (24.08 % homozygous), Virunga Mountain Gorilla (78.12 %), inbred Abyssinian cat (62.63 %), Tasmanian devil, domestic dog and other mammalian species. Demographic estimators impute two ancestral population bottlenecks: one >100,000 years ago coincident with cheetah migrations out of the Americas and into Eurasia and Africa, and a second 11,084-12,589 years ago in Africa coincident with late Pleistocene large mammal extinctions. MHC class I gene loss and dramatic reduction in functional diversity of MHC genes would explain why cheetahs ablate skin graft rejection among unrelated individuals. Significant excess of non-synonymous mutations in AKAP4 (p < 0.02), a gene mediating spermatozoon development, indicates cheetah fixation of five function-damaging amino acid variants distinct from AKAP4 homologues of other Felidae or mammals; AKAP4 dysfunction may cause the cheetah's extremely high (>80 %) pleiomorphic sperm. Conclusions: The study provides an unprecedented genomic perspective for the rare cheetah, with potential relevance to the species' natural history, physiological adaptations and unique reproductive disposition.

Detection of all these types of mutations requires whole-genome sequencing (WGS). In this study, advanced massively parallel WGS was performed on three 5- to 10-cell biopsies from two blastocyst-stage embryos. Both parents and paternal grandparents were also analyzed to allow for accurate measurements of false-positive and false-negative error rates. Overall, >95% of each genome was called. In the embryos, experimentally derived haplotypes and barcoded read data were used to detect and phase up to 82% of de novo single base mutations with a false-positive rate of about one error per Gb, resulting in fewer than 10 such errors per embryo. This represents a similar to 100-fold lower error rate than previously published from 10 cells, and it is the first demonstration that advanced WGS can be used to accurately identify these de novo mutations in spite of the thousands of false-positive errors introduced by the extensive DNA amplification required for deep sequencing. Using haplotype information, we also demonstrate how small de novo deletions could be detected. These results suggest that phased WGS using barcoded DNA could be used in the future as part of the PGD process to maximize comprehensiveness in detecting disease-causing mutations and to reduce the incidence of genetic diseases.

Here, we present a genomic resource built on the basis of a wild-caught male ZZ central bearded dragon Pogona vitticeps. Findings: The genomic sequence for P. vitticeps, generated on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform, comprised 317 Gbp (179X raw read depth) from 13 insert libraries ranging from 250 bp to 40 kbp. After filtering for low-quality and duplicated reads, 146 Gbp of data (83X) was available for assembly. Exceptionally high levels of heterozygosity (0.85 % of single nucleotide polymorphisms plus sequence insertions or deletions) complicated assembly; nevertheless, 96.4 % of reads mapped back to the assembled scaffolds, indicating that the assembly included most of the sequenced genome. Length of the assembly was 1.8 Gbp in 545,310 scaffolds (69,852 longer than 300 bp), the longest being 14.68 Mbp. N50 was 2.29 Mbp. Genes were annotated on the basis of de novo prediction, similarity to the green anole Anolis carolinensis, Gallus gallus and Homo sapiens proteins, and P. vitticeps transcriptome sequence assemblies, to yield 19,406 protein-coding genes in the assembly, 63 % of which had intact open reading frames. Our assembly captured 99 % (246 of 248) of core CEGMA genes, with 93 % (231) being complete. Conclusions: The quality of the P. vitticeps assembly is comparable or superior to that of other published squamate genomes, and the annotated P. vitticeps genome can be accessed through a genome browser available at https://genomics.canberra.edu.au.

Chinese indigenous pig breeds and exotic species vary greatly in terms of muscle production and performance traits. We present transcriptome profiles of 110 skeletal muscle samples from Tongcheng (TC) and Yorkshire (YK) pigs at 11 developmental periods (30, 40, 55, 63, 70, 90, and 105 days of gestation, and 0, 1, 3, and 5 weeks of age) using digital gene expression on Solexa/Illumina's Genome Analyzer platform to investigate the differences in prenatal and postnatal skeletal muscle between the two breeds. Results: Muscle morphological changes indicate the importance of primary fiber formation from 30 to 40 dpc (days post coitus), and secondary fiber formation from 55 to 70 dpc. We screened 4,331 differentially expressed genes in TC and 2,259 in YK (log(2) ratio > 1 and probability >0.7). Cluster analysis showed different gene expression patterns between TC and YK pigs. The transcripts were annotated in terms of Gene Ontology related to muscle development. We found that the genes CXCL10, EIF2B5, PSMA6, FBXO32, and LOC100622249 played vital roles in the muscle regulatory networks in the TC breed, whereas the genes SGCD, ENG, THBD, AQP4, and BTG2 played dominant roles in the YK breed. These genes showed breed-specific and development-dependent differential expression patterns. Furthermore, 984 genes were identified in myogenesis. A heat map showed that significantly enriched pathways (FDR <0.05) had stage-specific functional regulatory mechanisms. Finally, the differentially expressed genes from our sequencing results were confirmed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Conclusions: This study detected many functional genes and showed differences in the molecular mechanisms of skeletal muscle development between TC and YK pigs. TC pigs showed slower muscle growth and more complicated genetic regulation than YK pigs. Many differentially expressed genes showed breed-specific expression patterns. Our data provide a better understanding of skeletal muscle developmental differences and valuable information for improving pork quality.

Cholera epidemics are caused by individual, genetically monomorphic lineages of Vibrio cholerae: the ongoing seventh pandemic, which has spread globally since 1961, is associated with lineage L2 of biotype El Tor. Previous genomic studies of the epidemiology of the seventh pandemic identified three successive sub-lineages within L2, designated waves 1 to 3, which spread globally from the Bay of Bengal on multiple occasions. However, these studies did not include samples from China, which also experienced multiple epidemics of cholera in recent decades. We sequenced the genomes of 71 strains isolated in China between 1961 and 2010, as well as eight from other sources, and compared them with 181 published genomes. The results indicated that outbreaks in China between 1960 and 1990 were associated with wave 1 whereas later outbreaks were associated with wave 2. However, the previously defined waves overlapped temporally, and are an inadequate representation of the shape of the global genealogy. We therefore suggest replacing them by a series of tightly delineated clades. Between 1960 and 1990 multiple such clades were imported into China, underwent further microevolution there and then spread to other countries. China was thus both a sink and source during the pandemic spread of V. cholerae, and needs to be included in reconstructions of the global patterns of spread of cholera.

We sequenced the exomes of three unrelated individuals affected by KPLBS and found de novo heterozygous mutations in KCNJ6 (GIRK2), which encodes an inwardly rectifying potassium channel and maps to the Down syndrome critical region between DIRK1A and DSCR4. In particular, two individuals shared an in-frame heterozygous deletion of three nucleotides (c.455_457del) leading to the loss of one amino acid (p.Thr152del). The third individual was heterozygous for a missense mutation (c.460G>A) which introduces an amino acid change from glycine to serine (p.Gly154Ser). In agreement with animal models, the present data suggest that these mutations severely impair the correct functioning of this potassium channel. Overall, these results establish KPLBS as a channelopathy and suggest that KCNJ6 (GIRK2) could also be a candidate gene for other lipodystrophies. We hope that these results will prompt investigations in this unexplored class of inwardly rectifying K+ channels.

The purpose of this study was to identify the genetic defect responsible for familial HR in a four-generation Chinese Han pedigree by exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing. Clinical features include skeletal deformities, teeth abnormalities, hearing impairments and variable serum phosphate level in patients of this family. A novel deletion mutation, c.1553delT (p. F518Sfs*4), was identified in the X-linked phosphate regulating endopeptidase homolog gene (PHEX). The mutation is predicted to result in prematurely truncated and loss-of-function PHEX protein. Our data suggest that exome sequencing is a powerful tool to discover mutation(s) in HR, a disorder with genetic and clinical heterogeneity. The findings may also provide new insights into the cause and diagnosis of HR, and have implications for genetic counseling and clinical management.

Design: Retrospective analysis of results obtained from 2,570 analyses. Setting: Reproductive genetic laboratory. Patient(s): The 2,570 samples comprised 1,170 individuals from the gamete donor programs; 1,124 individuals corresponding to the partner of the patient receiving the donated gamete; and 276 individuals from 138 couples seeking ART using their own gametes. Intervention(s): None. Main Outcome Measure(s): Next-generation sequencing of 549 recessive and X-linked genes involved in severe childhood phenotypes reinforced with five complementary tests covering high prevalent mutations not detected by next-generation sequencing. Result(s): Preclinical validation included 48 DNA samples carrying known mutations for 27 genes, resulting in a sensitivity of 99%. In the clinical dataset, 2,161 samples (84%) tested positive, with an average carrier burden of 2.3 per sample. Five percent of the couples using their own gametes were found to have pathogenic variants conferring high risk for six different diseases. These high-risk couples and patients received genetic counseling and recommendations for preimplantation genetic diagnosis. For patients receiving gamete donation, we applied a genetic testing and blinded matching system to avoid high-risk combinations regardless of their carrier burden. For female donors, 1.94% were positive for X-linked conditions; they received genetic counselling and were discarded. Conclusion(s): We have developed a comprehensive carrier genetic screening test that, combined with our matching system and genetic counseling, constitutes a powerful tool to avoid more than 600 mendelian diseases in the offspring of patients undergoing ART.

Role of Gut Microorganisms	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							POLYETHYLENE-DEGRADING BACTERIUM; RHODOCOCCUS-RUBER; MICROBIAL-DEGRADATION; BIOFILM FORMATION; ACCUMULATION; WAXWORMS; DEBRIS; STRAIN; WASTE; OCEAN	The role of gut bacteria of mealworms (the larvae of Tenebrio molitor Linnaeus) in polystyrene (PS) degradation was investigated. Gentamicin was the most effective inhibitor of gut bacteria among six antibiotics tested. Gut bacterial activities were essentially suppressed by feeding gentamicin food (30 mg/g) for 10 days. Gentamicin-feeding mealworms lost the ability to depolymerize PS and mineralize PS into CO2, as determined by characterizing worm fecula and feeding with C-13-labeled PS. A PS-degrading bacterial strain was isolated from the guts of the mealworms, Exiguo bacterium sp. strain YT2, which could form biofilm on PS film over a 28 day incubation period and made obvious pits and cavities (0.2-0.3 mm in width) on PS film surfaces associated with decreases in hydrophobicity and the formation of C-O polar groups. A suspension culture of strain YT2 (10(8) cells/mL) was able to degrade 7.4 +/- 0.4% of the PS pieces (2500 mg/L) over a 60 day incubation period. The molecular weight of the residual PS pieces was lower, and the release of water-soluble daughter products was detected. The results indicated the essential role of gut bacteria in PS biodegradation and mineralization, confirmed the presence of PS-degrading gut bacteria, and demonstrated the biodegradation of PS by mealworms.

The current phylogenetic tree of the genus Flaveria contains 21 of the 23 known Flaveria species and has been previously constructed using a combination of morphological data and three non-coding DNA sequences (nuclear encoded ETS, ITS and chloroplast encoded trnL-F). Results: Here we developed a new strategy to update the phylogenetic tree of 16 Flaveria species based on RNA-Seq data. The updated phylogeny is largely congruent with the previously published tree but with some modifications. We propose that the data collection method provided in this study can be used as a generic method for phylogenetic tree reconstruction if the target species has no genomic information. We also showed that a "F. pringlei" genotype recently used in a number of labs may be a hybrid between F. pringlei (C-3) and F. angustifolia (C-3-C-4). Conclusions: We propose that the new strategy of obtaining phylogenetic sequences outlined in this study can be used to construct robust trees in a larger number of taxa. The updated Flaveria phylogenetic tree also supports a hypothesis of stepwise and parallel evolution of C-4 photosynthesis in the Flavaria clade.

Pandemic clones, responsible for recent outbreaks of gastroenteritis in humans, have spread globally. However, there are oceanic gene pools, one located in the oceans surrounding Asia and another in the Mexican Gulf. Frequent recombination means that most isolates have acquired the genetic profile of their current location. We investigated the genetic structure in the Asian gene pool by calculating the effective population size in two different ways. Under standard neutral models, the two estimates should give similar answers but we found a 27-fold difference. We propose that this discrepancy is caused by the subdivision of the species into a hundred or more ecotypes which are maintained stably in the population. To investigate the genetic factors involved, we used 51 unrelated isolates to conduct a genome-wide scan for epistatically interacting loci. We found a single example of strong epistasis between distant genome regions. A majority of strains had a type VI secretion system associated with bacterial killing. The remaining strains had genes associated with biofilm formation and regulated by cyclic dimeric GMP signaling. All strains had one or other of the two systems and none of isolate had complete complements of both systems, although several strains had remnants. Further "top down" analysis of patterns of linkage disequilibrium within frequently recombining species will allow a detailed understanding of how selection acts to structure the pattern of variation within natural bacterial populations.

As one of the most common biomarkers for mitochondrial dysfunction, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number has also been linked to autism, but the relationship between mtDNA copy number and autism was still obscured. In this study, we performed a case-control study to investigate whether mtDNA copy number in peripheral blood cells is related to patients with autism. Methods: Relative mtDNA copy number in peripheral blood cells was measured by using real-time polymerase chain reaction method. The participants in this study included 78 patients with childhood autism and 83 typically developing children. Results: We observed children with autism had significantly elevated relative mtDNA copy number than healthy controls (Beta = -0.173, P = 0.0003). However, there were no significant correlations between mtDNA copy number and clinical features (paternal age, maternal age, age of onset, illness of duration, CARS score and ABC score) in childhood autism. Conclusion: We show that elevated mtDNA copy number in peripheral blood is associated with autism, indicating that there may be mitochondrial dysfunction in children with autism.

To address this challenge, we assembled or collected the genomes of 48 avian species spanning most orders of birds, including all Neognathae and two of the five Palaeognathae orders. We used these genomes to construct a genome-scale avian phylogenetic tree and perform comparative genomic analyses. Findings: Here we present the datasets associated with the phylogenomic analyses, which include sequence alignment files consisting of nucleotides, amino acids, indels, and transposable elements, as well as tree files containing gene trees and species trees. Inferring an accurate phylogeny required generating: 1) A well annotated data set across species based on genome synteny; 2) Alignments with unaligned or incorrectly overaligned sequences filtered out; and 3) Diverse data sets, including genes and their inferred trees, indels, and transposable elements. Our total evidence nucleotide tree (TENT) data set (consisting of exons, introns, and UCEs) gave what we consider our most reliable species tree when using the concatenation-based ExaML algorithm or when using statistical binning with the coalescence-based MP-EST algorithm (which we refer to as MP-EST*). Other data sets, such as the coding sequence of some exons, revealed other properties of genome evolution, namely convergence. Conclusions: The Avian Phylogenomics Project is the largest vertebrate phylogenomics project to date that we are aware of. The sequence, alignment, and tree data are expected to accelerate analyses in phylogenomics and other related areas.

Within the reptilian tetrapods, geckos possess several interesting features, including the ability to regenerate autotomized tails and to climb on smooth surfaces. Here we sequence the genome of Gekko japonicus (Schlegel's Japanese Gecko) and investigate genetic elements related to its physiology. We obtain a draft G. japonicus genome sequence of 2.55 Gb and annotated 22,487 genes. Comparative genomic analysis reveals specific gene family expansions or reductions that are associated with the formation of adhesive setae, nocturnal vision and tail regeneration, as well as the diversification of olfactory sensation. The obtained genomic data provide robust genetic evidence of adaptive evolution in reptiles.

Chemical and Physical Characterization and Isotopic Tests	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							POLYETHYLENE; SOIL; NMR; ACCUMULATION; FORMALDEHYDE; DEGRADATION; TERMITES; WAXWORMS; DEBRIS; OCEAN	Polystyrene (PS) is generally considered to be durable and resistant to biodegradation. Mealworms (the larvae of Tenebrio molitor Linnaeus) from different sources chew and eat Styrofoam, a common PS product. The Styrofoam was efficiently degraded in the larval gut within a retention time of less than 24 h. Fed with Styrofoam as the sole diet, the larvae lived as well as those fed with a normal diet (bran) over a period of 1 month. The analysis of fecula egested from Styrofoam-feeding larvae, using gel permeation chromatography (GPC), solid-state C-13 cross-polarization/magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (CP/MAS NMR) spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric Fourier transform infrared (TG FTIR) spectroscopy, substantiated that cleavage/depolymerization of long-chain PS molecules and the formation of depolymerized metabolites occurred in the larval gut. Within a 16 day test period, 47.7% of the ingested Styrofoam carbon was converted into CO2 and the residue (ca. 49.2%) was egested as fecula with a limited fraction incorporated into biomass (ca. 0.5%). Tests with alpha C-13- or beta C-13-labeled PS confirmed that the C-13-labeled PS was mineralized to (CO2)-C-13 and incorporated into lipids. The discovery of the rapid biodegradation of PS in the larval gut reveals a new fate for plastic waste in the environment.

We strictly controlled the false positive rate associated with SWATH MS signals and carefully selected the target peptides coupled with SWATH and MRM. We collected 10 samples of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tissues paired with tumors and adjacent regions and quantified 1758 unique proteins with FDR 1% at protein level using SWATH, in which 467 proteins were abundance-dependent with ESCC. After carefully evaluating the SWATH MS signals of the up-regulated proteins, we selected 120 proteins for MRM verification. MRM analysis of the pooled and individual esophageal tissues resulted in 116 proteins that exhibited similar abundance response modes to ESCC that were acquired with SWATH. Because the ESCC-related proteins consisted of a high percentile of secreted proteins, we conducted the MRM assay on patient sera that were collected from pre- and postoperation. Of the 116 target proteins, 42 were identified in the ESCC sera, including 11 with lowered abundances postoperation. Coupling SWATH and MRM is thus feasible and efficient for the discovery and verification of cancer-related protein biomarkers.

Methods: Eight families at risk for DMD were recruited for this study. Parental haplotypes were constructed using target-region sequencing data from the parents and the probands. Fetal haplotypes were constructed using a hidden Markov model through maternal plasma DNA sequencing. The presence of haplotypes linked to the maternal mutant alleles in males indicated affected fetuses. This method was further validated by comparing the inferred single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes to the direct sequencing results of fetal genomic DNA. Prenatal diagnosis was confirmed with amniocentesis, and those results were interpreted in a blinded fashion. Results: The results showed an average accuracy of 99.98% for the total inferred maternal SNPs. With a mean depth of 30x achieved in the 10-Mb target region of each sample, the noninvasive results were consistent with those of the invasive procedure. Conclusion: This is the first report of NIPT for DMD and the first application of a haplotype-based approach in NIPT for X-linked diseases. With further improvements in accuracy, this haplotype-based strategy could be feasible for NIPT for DMD and even other X-linked single-gene disorders.

Method: A retrospective analysis of 23 067 pregnancies that received noninvasive prenatal testing from January 2012 to October 2013, including 22 650 normal singleton pregnancies (control group) and 417 pregnancies with aneuploidy, twin pregnancy, or various maternal conditions including preexisting hypertension, preexisting diabetes, hyperthyroidism, and carrier of the surface antigen of the hepatitis B virus (HBsAg; study group). Multiples of the median (MoM) analysis was performed in the control group to derive gestation and body mass index (BMI)-corrected fetal fraction. The effects of study group conditions on fetal fraction were examined by calculating the ratio of MoM (RMoM) values. Results: Fetal fraction showed a positive correlation with gestational age (r(2) = .10, P < .001) and increased rapidly after the 21 weeks of gestation (r(2) = .26, P < .001). Negative association with maternal BMI was found with fetal fraction (r(2) = .04, P < .001). In study group, fetal fraction was higher among pregnant women with a trisomy 21 fetus (RMoM = 1.24, P < .001) and lower among trisomy 18 (RMoM = 0.84, P < .001). A 1.6-fold incensement of fetal fraction was observed in twin fetuses comparing to singleton pregnancy (RMoM = 1.62, P < .001). Women with preexisting hypertension had significantly lower fetal fraction (RMoM = 0.85, P = .02). Preexisting diabetes, hyperthyroidism, or carrier of HBsAg did not affect fetal fraction. Conclusion: The fetal fraction was affected by fetal aneuploidy, maternal BMI, and the number of gestation. Maternal preexisting of hypertension appeared to reduce fetal fraction.

Although phototropins have been well-characterized in Arabidopsis thaliana, their evolutionary history is largely unknown. In this study, we complete an in-depth survey of phototropin homologs across land plants and algae using newly available transcriptomic and genomic data. We show that phototropins originated in an ancestor of Viridiplantae (land plants + green algae). Phototropins repeatedly underwent independent duplications in most major land-plant lineages (mosses, lycophytes, ferns, and seed plants), but remained single-copy genes in liverworts and hornworts-an evolutionary pattern shared with another family of photoreceptors, the phytochromes. Following each major duplication event, the phototropins differentiated in parallel, resulting in two specialized, yet partially overlapping, functional forms that primarily mediate either low-or high-light responses. Our detailed phylogeny enables us to not only uncover new phototropin lineages, but also link our understanding of phototropin function in Arabidopsis with what is known in Adiantum and Physcomitrella (the major model organisms outside of flowering plants). We propose that the convergent functional divergences of phototropin paralogs likely contributed to the success of plants through time in adapting to habitats with diverse and heterogeneous light conditions.

For many cases of ANSD, the underlying molecular pathology and the site of lesion remain unclear. The X-linked form of the condition, AUNX1, has been mapped to Xq23-q27.3, although the causative gene has yet to be identified. Methods We performed whole-exome sequencing on DNA samples from the AUNX1 family and another small phenotypically similar but unrelated ANSD family. Results We identified two missense mutations in AIFM1 in these families: c.1352G>A (p.R451Q) in the AUNX1 family and c.1030C>T (p.L344F) in the second ANSD family. Mutation screening in a large cohort of 3 additional unrelated families and 93 sporadic cases with ANSD identified 9 more missense mutations in AIFM1. Bioinformatics analysis and expression studies support this gene as being causative of ANSD. Conclusions Variants in AIFM1 gene are a common cause of familial and sporadic ANSD and provide insight into the expanded spectrum of AIFM1-associated diseases. The finding of cochlear nerve hypoplasia in some patients was AIFM1-related ANSD implies that MRI may be of value in localising the site of lesion and suggests that cochlea implantation in these patients may have limited success.

Both male and female patients suffer from sensory neuronal hearing loss in early childhood, and female patients are characterized by premature ovarian failure and infertility after puberty. Clinical diagnosis may not be possible in early life, because key features of PRLTS, for example infertility and premature ovarian failure, do not appear before puberty. Limb spasticity, muscle weakness, and intellectual disability have also been observed in PRLTS patients. Mutations in five genes, HSD17B4, HARS2, CLPP, LARS2, and C10orf2, have been reported in five subtypes of PRLTS. We discovered a consanguineous Saudi family with the PRLTS3 phenotype showing an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. The patients had developed profound hearing loss, brain atrophy, and lower limb spasticity in early childhood. For molecular diagnosis, we complimented genome-wide homozygosity mapping with whole exome sequencing analyses and identified a novel homozygous mutation in exon 6 of CLPP at chromosome 19p13.3. To our knowledge, early onset with regression is a unique feature of these PRLTS patients that has not been reported so far. This study broadens the clinical spectrum of PRLTS3.

Methods Thirty-five critically ill patients with sepsis were included. These patients were further divided into sepsis (12 cases) and severe sepsis (23 cases) groups or survivor (20 cases) and non-survivor (15 cases) groups. Serum samples from the patients were collected on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14 following intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and the serum concentrations of 42 amino acids were measured. Results The metabolic spectrum of the amino acids changed dramatically in patients with sepsis. As the disease progressed further or with poor prognosis, the levels of the different amino acids gradually increased, decreased, or fluctuated over time. The concentrations of sulfurcontaining amino acids (SAAs), especially taurine, decreased significantly as the severity of sepsis worsened or with poor prognosis of the patient. The serum concentrations of SAAs, especially taurine, exhibited weak negative correlations with the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) (r=-0.319) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II (r=-0.325) scores. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of cystine, taurine, and SAA levels and the SOFA and APACHE II scores, which denoted disease prognosis, were 0.623, 0.674, 0.678, 0.86, and 0.857, respectively. Conclusions Critically ill patients with disorders of amino acid metabolism, especially of SAAs such as cystine and taurine, may provide an indicator of the need for the nutritional support of sepsis in the clinic.

However, identification of domestication-related loci/genes of controlling the traits in soybean is rarely reported. In this study, we identified a total of 48 domestication-related loci based on RAD-seq genotyping of a natural population comprising 286 accessions. Among these, four on chromosome 12 and additional two on chromosomes 11 and 15 were associated with flowering time, and four on chromosomes 11 and 16 were associated with seed size. Of the five genes associated with flowering time and the three genes associated with seed size, three genes Glyma11g18720, Glyma11g15480 and Glyma15g35080 were homologous to Arabidopsis genes, additional five genes were found for the first time to be associated with these two traits. Glyma11g18720 and Glyma05g28130 were co-expressed with five genes homologous to flowering time genes in Arabidopsis, and Glyma11g15480 was co-expressed with 24 genes homologous to seed development genes in Arabidopsis. This study indicates that integration of population divergence analysis, genome-wide association study and expression analysis is an efficient approach to identify candidate domestication-related genes.

We have reported a nonsense mutation in PIK3R1, which encodes the regulatory subunit of PI3K, in a metastatic RCC (mRCC), while the mutation was absent in the corresponding primary RCC (pRCC). To identify the function of PIK3R1 in RCC, we examined its expression in normal kidney, pRCC and mRCC by immunohistochemistry and real-time polymerase chain reaction. The expression of PIK3R1 significantly decreased in pRCC and was further reduced in mRCC compared with normal tissue. Besides, its expression levels were negatively correlated with T-category of tumor stage. Additionally, 786-O and A-704 cells with PIK3R1 depletion introduced by CRISPR/Cas9 system displayed enhanced proliferation, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and acquired a stem-like phenotype. Moreover, the PIK3R1 depletion promoted the phosphorylation of AKT in the cells. The knockdown of AKT by shRNA reduced p-GSK3 beta and CTNNB1 expression in the cells, while the depletion of CTNNB1 impaired stem-like phenotype of the cells. Overall, PIK3R1 down-regulation in RCC promotes propagation, migration, EMT and stem-like phenotype in renal cancer cells through the AKT/GSK3 beta/CTNNB1 pathway, and may contribute to progression and metastasis of RCC.

Frequent proviral integration of the human betaretrovirus in biliary epithelium of patients with autoimmune and idiopathic liver disease	ALIMENTARY PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							MAMMARY-TUMOR VIRUS; EPSTEIN-BARR-VIRUS; T-CELL APOPTOSIS; ANTIMITOCHONDRIAL ANTIBODY; CIRRHOSIS; HEPATITIS; INFECTION; DISORDERS; RECEPTOR; SITE	BackgroundA human betaretrovirus (HBRV) has been linked with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) following the detection of viral particles in biliary epithelium by electron microscopy and cloning of the betaretrovirus genome from biliary epithelium and peri-hepatic lymph nodes. Evidence for viral infection was found in the majority of PBC patients' peri-hepatic lymph node samples. However, less than a third of the liver samples had detectable HBRV, whereas others were unable to detect betaretrovirus infection or noted the presence of virus in the liver of patients with other diagnoses. AimsTo address the hypothesis that the betaretrovirus may be below the limits of detection in the liver, biliary epithelial cells (BEC) were investigated for the evidence of infection. MethodsLigation-mediated PCR and next generation sequencing were used to detect proviral integrations in liver, lymph nodes and BEC isolated from liver transplant recipients. Hybridisation-based assays were used to detect betaretroviral RNA in BEC. ResultsUnique HBRV integrations and betaretrovirus RNA were detected in the majority of biliary epithelia derived from patients with PBC, autoimmune hepatitis and cryptogenic liver disease but rarely in other liver transplant recipients with primary sclerosing cholangitis and other hepatic disorders. HBRV integrations were commonly found in PBC patients' lymph nodes but rarely in whole liver samples. ConclusionsHuman betaretrovirus infection is frequently observed at the site of disease in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and also in biliary epithelium of patients with autoimmune hepatitis and cryptogenic liver disease.

We report siblings with congenital sensorineural deafness and lactic acidemia in association with combined respiratory chain (RC) deficiencies of complexes I, III and IV observed in fibroblasts and liver. One of the siblings had a more severe phenotype showing progressive hepatic and renal failure. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a homozygous mutation in the gene encoding mitochondrial ribosomal protein S7 (MRPS7), a c.550A>G transition that encodes a substitution of valine for a highly conserved methionine (p.Met184Val) in both affected siblings. MRPS7 is a 12S ribosomal RNA-binding subunit of the small mitochondrial ribosomal subunit, and is required for the assembly of the small ribosomal subunit. Pulse labeling of mitochondrial protein synthesis products revealed impaired mitochondrial protein synthesis in patient fibroblasts. Exogenous expression of wild-type MRPS7 in patient fibroblasts rescued complexes I and IV activities, demonstrating the deleterious effect of the mutation on RC function. Moreover, reduced 12S rRNA transcript levels observed in the patient's fibroblasts were also restored to normal levels by exogenous expression of wild-type MRPS7. Our data demonstrate the pathogenicity of the identified MRPS7 mutation as a novel cause of mitochondrial RC dysfunction, congenital sensorineural deafness and progressive hepatic and renal failure.

To explore the genetic basis of this condition, we successfully sequenced similar to 650 infertility-related genes in 757 NOA patients and 709 fertile males. We evaluated the contributions of rare variants to the etiology of NOA by identifying individual genes showing nominal associations and testing the genetic burden of a given biological process as a whole. We found a significant excess of rare, non-silent variants in genes that are key epigenetic regulators of spermatogenesis, such as BRWD1, DNMT1, DNMT3B, RNF17, UBR2, USP1 and USP26, in NOA patients (P = 5.5 x 10(-7)), corresponding to a carrier frequency of 22.5% of patients and 13.7% of controls (P = 1.4 x 10(-5)). An accumulation of low-frequency variants was also identified in additional epigenetic genes (BRDT and MTHFR).

Here, we describe a large seven-generation Chinese family with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss that has been excluded as being caused by known deafness gene mutations associated with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss with the aim of identifying a novel causative gene involved in deafness. Methods: Whole-exome sequencing was conducted in three affected family members, and cosegregation analysis was performed on other members of the family. Results: Whole-exome sequencing and subsequent segregation analysis identified a heterozygous frameshift mutation (c.153_154delCT, p.Gln53Argfs*100) in the oxysterol binding protein-like 2 (OSBPL2) gene in 25 affected family members. The deletion mutation is predicted to lead to premature truncation of the OSBPL2 protein. Modeling and structure-based analysis support the theory that this gene deletion is functionally deleterious. Our finding was further confirmed by the detection of another missense mutation, a c.583C>A transversion (p.Leu195Met) in exon 7 of OSBPL2, in an additional sporadic case of deafness. Conclusion: Based on this study, OSBPL2 was identified as an excellent novel candidate gene for autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss; this study is the first to implicate OSBPL2 mutations in autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss.

Hypomorphic mutations in the non-homologous end-joining gene DCLRE1C (encoding ARTEMIS) have been described to cause atypical SCID, Omenn syndrome, Hyper IgM syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease-all with severely impaired T-cell immunity. By whole-exome sequencing, we investigated the molecular defect in a consanguineous family with three children clinically diagnosed with antibody deficiency. We identified perfectly segregating homozygous variants in DCLRE1C in three index patients with recurrent respiratory tract infections, very low B-cell numbers and serum IgA levels. In patients, decreased colony survival after irradiation, impaired proliferative response and reduced counts of naive T cells were observed in addition to a restricted T-cell receptor repertoire, increased palindromic nucleotides in the complementarity determining regions 3 and long stretches of microhomology at switch junctions. Defective V(D)J recombination was complemented by wild-type ARTEMIS protein in vitro. Subsequently, homozygous or compound heterozygous DCLRE1C mutations were identified in nine patients from the same geographic region. We demonstrate that DCLRE1C mutations can cause a phenotype presenting as only antibody deficiency. This novel association broadens the clinical spectrum associated with ARTEMIS mutations. Clinicians should consider the possibility that an immunodeficiency with a clinically mild initial presentation could be a combined immunodeficiency, so as to provide appropriate care for affected patients.

Response to Comment on "Whole-genome analyses resolve early branches in the tree of life of modern birds"	SCIENCE			English	Editorial Material							RADIATION; RECORD; CLOCK; CHINA	Mitchell et al. argue that divergence- time estimates for our avian phylogeny were too young because of an " inappropriate" maximum age constraint for the most recent common ancestor of modern birds and that, as a result, most modern bird orders diverged before the Cretaceous- Paleogene mass extinction event 66 million years ago instead of after. However, their interpretations of the fossil record and timetrees are incorrect.

However, the characteristics of resistance gene analogues (RGAs) and Verticillium dahliae response loci (VdRLs) have not been investigated on a global scale. In this study, the characteristics of RGA genes were systematically analysed using bioinformatics-driven methods. Moreover, the potential VdRLs involved in the defence response to Verticillium wilt were identified by RNA-seq and correlations with known resistance QTLs. Results: The G. raimondii genome encodes 1004 RGA genes, and most of these genes cluster in homology groups based on high levels of similarity. Interestingly, nearly half of the RGA genes occurred in 26 RGA-gene-rich clusters (Rgrcs). The homology analysis showed that sequence exchanges and tandem duplications frequently occurred within Rgrcs, and segmental duplications took place among the different Rgrcs. An RNA-seq analysis showed that the RGA genes play roles in cotton defence responses, forming 26 VdRLs inside in the Rgrcs after being inoculated with V. dahliae. A correlation analysis found that 12 VdRLs were adjacent to the known Verticillium wilt resistance QTLs, and that 5 were rich in NB-ARC domain-containing disease resistance genes. Conclusions: The cotton genome contains numerous RGA genes, and nearly half of them are located in clusters, which evolved by sequence exchanges, tandem duplications and segmental duplications. In the Rgrcs, 26 loci were induced by the V. dahliae inoculation, and 12 are in the vicinity of known Verticillium wilt resistance QTLs.

Her life-long physician felt that the disorder was unique in the world and that future treatments for age-related diseases might emerge from its study. The objectives of our research were to determine if other such cases exist, and if so, whether aging is actually slowed. Of seven children characterized by dramatically slow developmental rates, five also had associated disorders displayed by the first case. All of the identified subjects were female. To objectively measure the age of blood tissue from these subjects, we used a highly accurate biomarker of aging known as "epigenetic clock" based on DNA methylation levels. No statistically significant differences in chronological and epigenetic ages were detected in any of the newly discovered cases. Our study shows that a) there are multiple children who maintain the facade of persistent toddler-like features while aging from birth to young adulthood and b) blood tissue from these cases is not younger than expected.

Though some genes have been identified to be associated with RP, still a large part of the clinical cases could not be explained. Here we reported a four-generation Chinese family with RP, during which 6 from 9 members of the second generation affected the disease. To identify the genetic defect in this family, whole-exome sequencing together with validation analysis by Sanger sequencing were performed to find possible pathogenic mutations. After a pipeline of database filtering, including public databases and in-house databases, a novel missense mutation, c. 424 C>. T transition (p.R142W) in OR2W3 gene, was identified as a potentially causative mutation for autosomal dominant RP. The mutation co-segregated with the disease phenotype over four generations. This mutation was validated in another independent three-generation family. RT-PCR analysis also identified that OR2W3 gene was expressed in HESC-RPE cell line. The results will not only enhance our current understanding of the genetic basis of RP, but also provide helpful clues for designing future studies to further investigate genetic factors for familial RP.

Congenital cataract is a visual impairment that needs correction as early as possible after birth. This study aimed to identify whether genetic defects exist in a Chinese Han pedigree with congenital nuclear cataract. Methods. A family consisting of six members and three patients with nuclear cataract spanning three generations and 100 unrelated ethnically matched normal subjects were recruited in this study. Exome sequencing was performed in the 24-year-old proband, and Sanger sequencing was then conducted in other family members and 100 normal controls. Results. A novel missense variant, c.428G>A (p.G143E), in the gap junction protein-alpha 3 gene (GJA3) was identified in three patients of the family but unidentified in three family members without lens opacity and 100 normal controls. Conclusions. A novel missense mutation, c.428G>A (p.G143E), in the GJA3 gene, localized to the cytoplasmic loop, was suggested to be the genetic cause of congenital nuclear cataract, which further expands the gene mutation spectrum. Our findings suggest that exome sequencing is a powerful and cost-effective tool to discover mutation(s) in disorders with high genetic and clinical heterogeneity. Further functional studies in the GJA3 gene mutations may help uncover pathogenic mechanisms of congenital cataract and therefore provide a possible genetic therapy for this disorder.

The genetic defect underlying KHLS remained undetermined. By performing whole-exome sequencing in a family with KHLS, we identified a heterozygous mutation (c.23G>T [p.Gly8Val]) in GJA1, which cosegregated with the phenotype in the family. In an additional affected individual, we also found the identical de novo mutation which was absent in his unaffected family members. GJA1 encodes a gap junction protein connexin 43 (Cx43) which is ubiquitously expressed in various organs, including the epidermis and hair follicles. In vitro studies on HEK293 cells expressing Cx43(GIY8Val) found that the protein formed gap junction plaques between adjacent transfected cells, as observed in the wild-type. Dye-transfer experiments by microinjection of Lucifer yellow displayed functional gap junction of the CX43(GIY8V) al mutant. Using patch clamp and Ca2+ imaging methods, we observed that the Cx43GIY8Val hemichannel had significantly more openings than Cx43(wT), facilitating Ca2+ influx at resting potential. Such gain-of-function effect might result in cytoplasmic Ca2+ overload, accelerated apoptosis of keratinocytes and subsequent skin hyperkeratosis. Taken together, our results demonstrated that, with probably enhanced hemichannel activities, a mutation in GJA1 is linked to KHLS without extracutaneous involvement.

Wild soybean (Glycine soja) shows strong alkaline stress tolerance, so it is an ideal plant candidate for studying the molecular mechanisms of alkaline tolerance and identifying alkaline stress-responsive genes. However, limited information is available about G. soja responses to alkaline stress on a genomic scale. Therefore, in the present study, we used RNA sequencing to compare transcript profiles of G. soja root responses to sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) at six time points, and a total of 68,138,478 pairs of clean reads were obtained using the Illumina GAIIX. Expression patterns of 46,404 G. soja genes were profiled in all six samples based on RNA-seq data using Cufflinks software. Then, t12 transcription factors from MYB, WRKY, NAC, bZIP, C2H2, HB, and TIFY families and 12 oxidation reduction related genes were chosen and verified to be induced in response to alkaline stress by using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The GO functional annotation analysis showed that besides "transcriptional regulation" and "oxidation reduction," these genes were involved in a variety of processes, such as "binding" and "response to stress." This is the first comprehensive transcriptome profiling analysis of wild soybean root under alkaline stress by RNA sequencing. Our results highlight changes in the gene expression patterns and identify a set of genes induced by NaHCO3 stress. These findings provide a base for the global analyses of G. soja alkaline stress tolerance mechanisms.

We introduce a method, mutational interference mapping experiment (MIME), to identify, at single-nucleotide resolution, the primary sequence and secondary structures of an RNA molecule that are crucial for its function. MIME is based on random mutagenesis of the RNA target followed by functional selection and next-generation sequencing. Our analytical approach allows the recovery of quantitative binding parameters and permits the identification of base-pairing partners directly from the sequencing data. We used this method to map the binding site of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIHIV-1) Pr55(Gag) protein on the viral genomic RNA in vitro, and showed that, by analyzing permitted base-pairing patterns, we could model RNA structure motifs that are crucial for protein binding.

However, a large fraction of these CNVs have not been accurately characterized at the single-base-pair level, thereby hampering a better understanding of the mutational mechanisms underlying CNV formation. Here, employing a composite pipeline method derived from various inference-based programs, we have characterized 26 deletion CNVs [including three novel pathogenic CNVs involving an autosomal gene (EXT2) causing hereditary osteochondromas and an X-linked gene (CLCN5) causing Dent disease, as well as 23 CNVs previously identified by inference from a cohort of Canadian autism spectrum disorder families] to the single-base-pair level of accuracy from whole-genome sequencing data. We found that breakpoint-flanking micro-mutations (within 22 bp of the breakpoint) are present in a significant fraction (5/26; 19 %) of the deletion CNVs. This analysis also provided evidence that a recently described error-prone form of DNA repair (i.e., repair of DNA double-strand breaks by templated nucleotide sequence insertions derived from distant regions of the genome) not only causes human genetic disease but also impacts on human genome evolution. Our findings illustrate the importance of precise CNV breakpoint delineation for understanding the underlying mutational mechanisms and have implications for primer design in relation to the detection of deletion CNVs in clinical diagnosis.

It was hypothesized that these phenotypic differences were due to stable genotypic changes in the fluoride-resistant strains. However, until now, no studies have reported these genotypic changes. The aim of this study is to identify such changes in a fluoride-resistant Streptococcus mutans strain (C180-2FR) using whole-genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing and to examine the potential function of the identified mutations by comparing gene expression between the fluoride-sensitive (C180-2) and C180-2FR strains. We performed 50 bp paired-end Illumina shotgun sequencing for both strains. Through extensive bioinformatic analysis, we were able to identify 8 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genome of C180-2FR, which were further confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Expression of the genes containing or in proximity to the SNPs in C180-2 and C180-2FR was then quantified by real-time PCR. A gene cluster containing genes coding for fluoride antiporters was up-regulated 10-fold in C180-2FR when compared to that in C180-2, independent of growth phase. Two SNPs are located in this gene cluster, one in its promoter region and the other in its protein-coding region. In addition, one gene, which codes for a putative glycerol uptake facilitator protein, was found to be down-regulated by 60% in C180-2FR at an early growth phase. The promoter region of this gene contained a SNP. No difference in expression was found for the other SNP-containing genes. In summary, using WGS sequencing, we were able to uncover genetic changes in the genome of a fluoride-resistant strain. These findings can provide new insights into the mechanism of microbial fluoride resistance.

Global gene expression profiling of brown to white adipose tissue transformation in sheep reveals novel transcriptional components linked to adipose remodeling	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article						BAT; Brite/beige adipose tissue; Global gene expression profiling; Mitochondrial number; Sheep; Transcription factors; UCP1; WAT	NF-KAPPA-B; X RECEPTOR-ALPHA; FAT DEVELOPMENT; MESSENGER-RNA; CELL LYMPHOMA; DIFFERENTIATION; PROTEIN; ACTIVATION; ADIPOCYTES; BRITE	Background: Large mammals are capable of thermoregulation shortly after birth due to the presence of brown adipose tissue (BAT). The majority of BAT disappears after birth and is replaced by white adipose tissue (WAT). Results: We analyzed the postnatal transformation of adipose in sheep with a time course study of the perirenal adipose depot. We observed changes in tissue morphology, gene expression and metabolism within the first two weeks of postnatal life consistent with the expected transition from BAT to WAT. The transformation was characterized by massively decreased mitochondrial abundance and down-regulation of gene expression related to mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation. Global gene expression profiling demonstrated that the time points grouped into three phases: a brown adipose phase, a transition phase and a white adipose phase. Between the brown adipose and the transition phase 170 genes were differentially expressed, and 717 genes were differentially expressed between the transition and the white adipose phase. Thirty-eight genes were shared among the two sets of differentially expressed genes. We identified a number of regulated transcription factors, including NR1H3, MYC, KLF4, ESR1, RELA and BCL6, which were linked to the overall changes in gene expression during the adipose tissue remodeling. Finally, the perirenal adipose tissue expressed both brown and brite/beige adipocyte marker genes at birth, the expression of which changed substantially over time. Conclusions: Using global gene expression profiling of the postnatal BAT to WAT transformation in sheep, we provide novel insight into adipose tissue plasticity in a large mammal, including identification of novel transcriptional components linked to adipose tissue remodeling. Moreover, our data set provides a useful resource for further studies in adipose tissue plasticity.

However, despite elucidation of its crystal structure and studies addressing its immunobiology, the function of Na-ASP-2 has remained elusive. We probed a 9000-protein human proteome microarray with Na-ASP-2 and showed binding to CD79A, a component of the B-cell antigen receptor complex. Na-ASP-2 bound to human B lymphocytes ex vivo and downregulated the transcription of approximately 1000 B-cell messenger RNAs (mRNAs), while only approximately 100 mRNAs were upregulated, compared with control-treated cells. The expression of a range of molecules was affected by Na-ASP-2, including factors involved in leukocyte transendothelial migration pathways and the B-cell signaling receptor pathway. Of note was the downregulated transcription of lyn and pi3k, molecules that are known to interact with CD79A and control B-cell receptor signaling processes. Together, these results highlight a previously unknown interaction between a hookworm-secreted protein and B cells, which has implications for helminth-driven immunomodulation and vaccine development. Further, the novel use of human protein microarrays to identify host-pathogen interactions, coupled with ex vivo binding studies and subsequent analyses of global gene expression in human host cells, demonstrates a new pipeline by which to explore the molecular basis of infectious diseases.

Here we present an integrated genomic and transcriptomic analysis of 335 primary lung adenocarcinomas and 35 corresponding lymph node metastases from Chinese patients. Altogether 13 significantly mutated genes are identified, including the most commonly mutated gene TP53 and novel mutation targets such as RHPN2, GLI3 and MRC2. TP53 mutations are furthermore significantly enriched in tumours from patients harbouring metastases. Genes regulating cytoskeleton remodelling processes are also frequently altered, especially in metastatic samples, of which the high expression level of IQGAP3 is identified as a marker for poor prognosis. Our study represents the first large-scale sequencing effort on lung adenocarcinoma in Asian patients and provides a comprehensive mutational landscape for both primary and metastatic tumours. This may thus form a basis for personalized medical care and shed light on the molecular pathogenesis of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma.

Understanding of mutational landscape for this subtype of lung cancer in Chinese patients is currently limited. We performed whole exome sequencing in samples from 100 patients with lung SQCCs to search for somatic mutations and the subsequent target capture sequencing in another 98 samples for validation. We identified 20 significantly mutated genes, including TP53, CDH10, NFE2L2 and PTEN. Pathways with frequently mutated genes included those of cell-cell adhesion/Wnt/Hippo in 76%, oxidative stress response in 21%, and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase in 36% of the tested tumor samples. Mutations of Chromatin regulatory factor genes were identified at a lower frequency. In functional assays, we observed that knockdown of CDH10 promoted cell proliferation, soft-agar colony formation, cell migration and cell invasion, and overexpression of CDH10 inhibited cell proliferation. This mutational landscape of lung SQCC in Chinese patients improves our current understanding of lung carcinogenesis, early diagnosis and personalized therapy.

The vegetable crop Jiaobai' with enlarged edible stems was domesticated from wild Zizania latifolia (Oryzeae) approximately 2000years ago as a result of persistent infection by a fungal endophyte, Ustilago esculenta. Asexual propagation via infected rhizomes is the only means of Jiaobai production, and the Z.latifolia-endophyte complex has been maintained continuously for two centuries. Here, genomic analysis revealed that cultivated Z.latifolia has a significantly smaller repertoire of immune receptors compared with wild Z.latifolia. There are widespread gene losses/mutations and expression changes in the plant-pathogen interaction pathway in Jiaobai. These results show that continuous long-standing endophyte association can have a major effect on the evolution of the structural and transcriptomic components of the host genome. Significance Statement This study reports the genome of Jiaobai, a unique crop species domesticated from wild Zizania latifolia (Oryzeae) as a consequence of persistent infection by a fungal endophyte. Cultivated Z.latifolia (Jiaobai') has a significantly smaller repertoire of immune receptors compared with wild Z.latifolia, showing that continuous long-standing endophyte association can have a major effect on the evolution of the host genome.

Four different but overlapping phenotypes (CGL1-4) have been identified, which are caused by mutations in AGPAT2 at 9q34.3, BSCL2 at 11q13, CAV1 at 7q31.1, and PTRF at 17q21.2. In this study, we performed genome-wide homozygosity mapping of two affected and one unaffected subject in a Saudi family using a 300K Human-CytoSNPs12v12.1 array with the Illumina iScan system. A common homozygous region at chromosome 17q22.1, from 34.4 to 45.3 Mb, was identified in both the affected individuals. The region is flanked by SNPs rs139433362 and rs185263326, which encompass the PTRF gene. Bidirectional DNA sequencing of the PTRF gene covering all of the coding exons and exoneintron boundaries was performed in all family members. Sequencing analysis identified a novel homozygous nonsense mutation in the PTRF gene (c. 550G> T; p. Glu184*), leading to a premature stop codon. To the best of our knowledge, we present a novel mutation of PTRF from Saudi Arabia and our findings broaden the mutation spectrum of PTRF in the familial CGL4 phenotype. Homozygosity mapping coupled with candidate gene sequencing is an effective tool for identifying the causative pathogenic variants in familial cases. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Water activity (a(w)) is one of the key factors influencing both fungal growth and mycotoxin production. In this study, we used the isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) technique to investigate the effect of a(w), on the proteomic profile of A. flavus. A total of 3566 proteins were identified, of which 837 were differentially expressed in response to variations in a,. Among these 837 proteins, 403 were over-expressed at 0.99 a(w), whereas 434 proteins were over-expressed at 0.93 a(w). According to Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, the secretion of extracellular hydrolases increased as a(w) was raised, suggesting that extracellular hydrolases may play a critical role in induction of aflatoxin biosynthesis. On the basis of Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) categorizations, we identified an exportin protein, KapK, that may down-regulate aflatoxin biosynthesis by changing the location of NirA. Finally, we considered the role of two osmotic stress-related proteins (Sln1 and Glo1) in the Hog1 pathway and investigated the expression patterns of proteins related to aflatoxin biosynthesis. The data uncovered in this study are critical for understanding the effect of water stress on toxin production and for the development of strategies to control toxin contamination of agricultural products.

We identified mean 26,982 editing sites with mean 89.5% canonical A -> G edits in each sample using an improved bioinformatics pipeline. The editing rate was significantly higher in tumors than adjacent normal tissues. Comparing the difference between tumor and normal tissues of each patient, we found 7 non-synonymous tissue specific editing events including 4 tumor-specific edits and 3 normal-specific edits in the coding region, as well as 292 edits varying in editing degree. The significant expression changes of 150 genes associated with RNA editing were found in tumors, with 3 of the 4 most significant genes being cancer related. Our results show that editing might be related to higher gene expression. These findings indicate that RNA editing modification may play an important role in the development of HCC.

These developments have allowed the recovery of several complete ancient genomes, a result that would have been considered virtually impossible only a decade ago. Prior to these developments, aDNA research was largely focused on the recovery of short DNA sequences and their use in the study of phylogenetic relationships, molecular rates, species identification and population structure. However, it is now possible to sequence a large number of modern and ancient complete genomes from a single species and thereby study the genomic patterns of evolutionary change over time. Such a study would herald the beginnings of ancient population genomics and its use in the study of evolution. Species that are amenable to such large-scale studies warrant increased research effort. We report here progress on a population genomic study of the Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae). This species is ideally suited to ancient population genomic research because both modern and ancient samples are abundant in the permafrost conditions of Antarctica. This species will enable us to directly address many of the fundamental questions in ecology and evolution.	[Parks, M.; Subramanian, S.; Lambert, D.

We report two Italian siblings presenting in their mid-50s with difficulty in walking, dysarthria and progressive cognitive decline. Visual loss, ascribed to glaucoma, manifested a few years before the other symptoms. Brain MRI showed severe cerebellar atrophy, prevalent in the vermis, with marked cortical atrophy of both hemispheres. Exome sequencing identified a novel homozygous mutation (c.935G > A;p.Ser312Asn) in the ceroid neuronal lipofuscinosis type 5 gene (CLN5). Bioinformatics predictions and in vitro studies showed that the mutation was deleterious and likely affects ER-lysosome protein trafficking. Our findings support CLN5 hypomorphic mutations cause autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia, confirming other reports showing CLN mutations are associated with adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders. We suggest CLN genes should be considered in the molecular analyses of patients presenting with adult-onset autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia.

Recent single-cell RNA-seq studies highlight the tumor heterogeneity present in most cancers, but virally induced tumors have not been studied. HeLa is a well characterized HPV+ cervical cancer cell line. Result: We developed a new high throughput platform to prepare single-cell RNA on a nanoliter scale based on a customized microwell chip. Using this method, we successfully amplified full-length transcripts of 669 single HeLa S3 cells and 40 of them were randomly selected to perform single-cell RNA sequencing. Based on these data, we obtained a comprehensive understanding of the heterogeneity of HeLa S3 cells in gene expression, alternative splicing and fusions. Furthermore, we identified a high diversity of HPV-18 expression and splicing at the single-cell level. By co-expression analysis we identified 283 E6, E7 co-regulated genes, including CDC25, PCNA, PLK4, BUB1B and IRF1 known to interact with HPV viral proteins. Conclusion: Our results reveal the heterogeneity of a virus-infected cell line. It not only provides a transcriptome characterization of HeLa S3 cells at the single cell level, but is a demonstration of the power of single cell RNA-seq analysis of virally infected cells and cancers.

In this study, 31,191 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) evenly distributed across the large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea) genome were identified using restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq). Among them, 10,150 high-confidence SNPs were assigned to 24 consensus linkage groups (LGs). The total length of the genetic linkage map was 5451.3 cM with an average distance of 0.54 cM between loci. This represents the densest genetic map currently reported for large yellow croaker. Using 2889 SNPs to target specific scaffolds, we assigned 533 scaffolds, comprising 421.44 Mb (62.04%) of the large yellow croaker assembled sequence, to the 24 linkage groups. The mapped assembly scaffolds in large yellow croaker were used for genome synteny analyses against the stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and medaka (Oryzias latipes). Greater synteny was observed between large yellow croaker and stickleback. This supports the hypothesis that large yellow croaker is more closely related to stickleback than to medaka. Moreover, 1274 immunity-related genes and 195 hypoxia-related genes were mapped to the 24 chromosomes of large yellow croaker. The integration of the high-resolution genetic map and the assembled sequence provides a valuable resource for fine mapping and positional cloning of quantitative trait loci associated with economically important traits in large yellow croaker.

Nevertheless, the evolutionary patterns of SBP-box genes and evolutionary forces driving them are still not well understood. Methods: 104 SBP-box gene candidates of five representative land plants were obtained from Phytozome database (v10.3). Phylogenetic combined with gene structure analyses were used to identify SBP-box gene lineages in land plants. Gene copy number and the sequence and structure features were then compared among these different SBP-box lineages. Selection analysis, relative rate tests and expression divergence were finally used to interpret the evolutionary relationships and divergence of SBP-box genes in land plants. Results: We investigated 104 SBP-box genes from moss, Arabidopsis, poplar, rice, and maize. These genes are divided into group I and II, and the latter is further divided into two subgroups (subgroup II-1 and II-2) based on phylogenetic analysis. Interestingly, subgroup II-1 genes have similar sequence and structural features to group I genes, whereas subgroup II-2 genes exhibit intrinsic differences on these features, including high copy numbers and the presence of miR156/miR529 regulation. Further analyses indicate that subgroup II-1 genes are constrained by stronger purifying selection and evolve at a lower substitution rate than II-2 genes, just as group I genes do when compared to II genes. Among subgroup II-2 genes, miR156 targets evolve more rapidly than miR529 targets and experience comparatively relaxed purifying selection. These results suggest that group I and subgroup II-1 genes under strong selective constraint are conserved. By contrast, subgroup II-2 genes evolve under relaxed purifying selection and have diversified through gene copy duplications and changes in miR156/529 regulation, which might contribute to morphological diversifications of land plants. Conclusions: Our results indicate that different evolutionary rates and selection strengths lead to differing evolutionary patterns in SBP-box genes in land plants, providing a guide for future functional diversity analyses of these genes.

However, genomic approaches have yet to be used to disentangle the evolutionary mechanisms that govern evolution of avian visual systems. Results: We performed comparative genomic analyses across 48 avian genomes that span extant bird phylogenetic diversity to assess evolutionary changes in the 17 representatives of the opsin gene family and five plumage coloration genes. Our analyses suggest modern birds have maintained a repertoire of up to 15 opsins. Synteny analyses indicate that PARA and PARIE pineal opsins were lost, probably in conjunction with the degeneration of the parietal organ. Eleven of the 15 avian opsins evolved in a non-neutral pattern, confirming the adaptive importance of vision in birds. Visual conopsins sw1, sw2 and lw evolved under negative selection, while the dim-light RH1 photopigment diversified. The evolutionary patterns of sw1 and of violet/ultraviolet sensitivity in birds suggest that avian ancestors had violet-sensitive vision. Additionally, we demonstrate an adaptive association between the RH2 opsin and the MC1R plumage color gene, suggesting that plumage coloration has been photic mediated. At the intra-avian level we observed some unique adaptive patterns. For example, barn owl showed early signs of pseudogenization in RH2, perhaps in response to nocturnal behavior, and penguins had amino acid deletions in RH2 sites responsible for the red shift and retinal binding. These patterns in the barn owl and penguins were convergent with adaptive strategies in nocturnal and aquatic mammals, respectively. Conclusions: We conclude that birds have evolved diverse opsin adaptations through gene loss, adaptive selection and coevolution with plumage coloration, and that differentiated selective patterns at the species level suggest novel photic pressures to influence evolutionary patterns of more-recent lineages.

We describe the use of this assay to screen 315 clinical samples from EVD suspected person in Sierra Leone. The detection rate in blood samples was 77.81% (207/266), and there were relatively higher detection rate (79.32% and 81.42%, respectively) during the first two weeks after onset of symptoms. In the two weeks that followed, the detection rate declined to 66.67% and 25.00%, respectively. There was the highest virus load at the first week and then decreased. The detection rate in swab samples was 89.79% (44/49). This may be benefit from the included patients. 46 of 49 swab samples were collected from died patients. Taken together, the results presented here indicate that the assay specifically and sensitively detects Zaire Ebola virus. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

On the basis of the first and second Chinese Chromosome Proteome Database (CCPD 1.0 and 2.0) studies, we developed systematic enrichment strategies to identify MPs that fell into four classes: (1) low molecular weight (LMW) proteins, (2) membrane proteins, (3) proteins that contained various post-translational modifications (PTMs), and (4) nucleic acid-associated proteins. Of 8845 proteins identified in 7 data sets, 79 proteins were classified as MPs. Among data sets derived from different enrichment strategies, data sets for LMW and PTM yielded the most novel MPs. In addition, we found that some MPs were identified in multiple-data sets, which implied that tandem enrichments methods might improve the ability to identify MPs. Moreover, low expression at the transcription level was the major cause of the "missing" of these MPs; however, MPs with higher expression level also evaded identification, most likely due to other characteristics such as LMW, high hydrophobicity and PTM. By combining a stringent manual check of the MS2 spectra with peptides synthesis verification, we confirmed 30 MPs (neXtProt PE2 similar to PE4) and 6 potential MPs (neXtProt PE5) with authentic MS evidence. By integrating our large-scale data sets of CCPD 2.0, the number of identified proteins has increased considerably beyond simulation saturation. Here, we show that special enrichment strategies can break through the data saturation bottleneck, which could increase the efficiency of MP identification in future C-HPP studies. All 7 data sets have been uploaded to ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD002255.

One of the most important rice pests, the brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (Stal) harbors an obligatory yeast-like symbiont (YLS) that cannot be cultured in vitro. Genomic information on this YLS would be useful to better understand its evolution. In this study, we performed genome sequencing of the YLS using both 454 and Illumina approaches, generating a draft genome that shows a slightly smaller genome size and relatively higher GC content than most ascomycete fungi. A phylogenomic analysis of the YLS supported its close relationship with insect pathogens. We analyzed YLS-specific genes and the categories of genes that are likely to have changed in the YLS during its evolution. The loss of mating type locus demonstrated in the YLS sheds light on the evolution of eukaryotic symbionts. This information about the YLS genome provides a helpful guide for further understanding endosymbiotic associations in hemiptera and the symbiotic replacement of ancient bacteria with a multifunctional YLS seems to have been a successful change.

The spectrum of muscular dystrophies and congenital myopathies extends to more than 50 diseases today, even excluding the common forms Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Myotonic Dystrophy and Facioscapulohumeral Dystrophy. Unfortunately, even by critical clinical evaluation and muscle pathology, diagnosis is still difficult. To potentially remediate this difficulty, we applied a microarray-based targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to diagnose these patients. There were 55 consecutive unrelated patients who underwent the test, 36 of which (65%) were found to have a causative mutation. Our result shows the accuracy and efficiency of next-generation sequencing in clinical circumstances and reflects the features and relative distribution of inherited myopathies in the Chinese population.

Ostrich meat is considered a healthy red meat, with an annual worldwide production ranging from 12,000 to 15,000 tons. As part of the avian phylogenomics project, we sequenced the ostrich genome for phylogenetic and comparative genomics analyses. The initial Illumina-based assembly of this genome had a scaffold N50 of 3.59 Mb and a total size of 1.23 Gb. Since longer scaffolds are critical for many genomic analyses, particularly for chromosome-level comparative analysis, we generated optical mapping (OM) data to obtain an improved assembly. The OM technique is a non-PCR-based method to generate genome-wide restriction enzyme maps, which improves the quality of de novo genome assembly. Findings: In order to generate OM data, we digested the ostrich genome with KpnI, which yielded 1.99 million DNA molecules (>250 kb) and covered the genome at least 500x. The pattern of molecules was subsequently assembled to align with the Illumina-based assembly to achieve sequence extension. This resulted in an OM assembly with a scaffold N50 of 17.71 Mb, which is 5 times as large as that of the initial assembly. The number of scaffolds covering 90% of the genome was reduced from 414 to 75, which means an average of similar to 3 super-scaffolds for each chromosome. Upon integrating the OM data with previously published FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) markers, we recovered the full PAR (pseudoatosomal region) on the ostrich Z chromosome with 4 super-scaffolds, as well as most of the degenerated regions. Conclusions: The OM data significantly improved the assembled scaffolds of the ostrich genome and facilitated chromosome evolution studies in birds. Similar strategies can be applied to other genome sequencing projects to obtain better assemblies.

MiR156 and miR529 are two combinatorial regulators of squamosa promoter binding protein-like (SBP-box) genes. Previous studies have clarified the evolutionary dynamics of their targets; however, there have been no reports on the evolutionary patterns of two miRNA regulators themselves to date. In this study, we investigated the evolutionary differences between these two miRNA families in extant land plants. Our work found that miR529 precursor, especially of its mature miRNA sequence, has a higher evolutionary rate. Such accelerating evolution of miR529 has significantly effects on its structural stability, and sequence conservation against existence of itself. By contrast, miR156 evolves more rapidly in loop region of the stable secondary structure, which may contribute to its functional diversity. Moreover, miR156 and miR529 genes have distinct rates of loss after identical duplication events. MiR529 genes have a higher average loss rate and asymmetric loss rate in duplicated gene pairs, indicating preferred miR529 gene losses become another predominant mode of inactivation, that are implicated in the contraction of this family. On the contrary, duplicated miR156 genes have a low loss rate, and could serve as another new source for functional diversity. Taken together, these results provide better insight into understanding the evolutionary divergence of miR156 and miR529 family in miRNA combinational regulation network.

Inference of Purifying and Positive Selection in Three Subspecies of Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) from Exome Sequencing	GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						fitness effect; mutation; selection; effective size	DELETERIOUS MUTATIONS; MOLECULAR EVOLUTION; POPULATION; DIVERGENCE; HISTORY; POLYMORPHISM; GENETICS; GENOMES; MODELS	We study genome-wide nucleotide diversity in three subspecies of extant chimpanzees using exome capture. After strict filtering, Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms and indels were called and genotyped for greater than 50% of exons at a mean coverage of 35x per individual. Central chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) are the most polymorphic (nucleotide diversity, theta(w) = 0.0023 per site) followed by Eastern (P. t. schweinfurthii) chimpanzees (theta(w) = 0.0016) and Western (P. t. verus) chimpanzees (theta(w) = 0.0008). A demographic scenario of divergence without gene flow fits the patterns of autosomal synonymous nucleotide diversity well except for a signal of recent gene flow from Western into Eastern chimpanzees. The striking contrast in X-linked versus autosomal polymorphism and divergence previously reported in Central chimpanzees is also found in Eastern and Western chimpanzees. We show that the direction of selection statistic exhibits a strong nonmonotonic relationship with the strength of purifying selection S, making it inappropriate for estimating S. We instead use counts in synonymous versus nonsynonymous frequency classes to infer the distribution of S coefficients acting on nonsynonymous mutations in each subspecies. The strength of purifying selection we infer is congruent with the differences in effective sizes of each subspecies: Central chimpanzees are undergoing the strongest purifying selection followed by Eastern and Western chimpanzees. Coding indels show stronger selection against indels changing the reading frame than observed in human populations.

Genetic testing has been approved to provide information for risk assessment and rationale for appropriate intervention. Testing methods currently available for clinical use have some limitations, including sensitivity and testing throughput, etc. Next generation sequencing (NGS) has been rapidly evolving to increase testing sensitivity and throughput. It can be potentially used to identify inherited mutation in clinical diagnostic setting. Here we develop an effective method employing target enrichment and NGS platform to detect common as well as rare mutations for all common hereditary cancers in a single assay. Single base substitution across 115 hereditary cancer related genes using YH (the first Asian genome) was characterized to validate our method. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 93.66, 99.98 and 99.97 %, were achieved, respectively. In addition, we correctly identified 53 SNVs and indels of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in two breast cancer specimens, all confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Accuracy in detecting copy number variation (CNV) was corroborated in 4 breast cancer specimens with known CNVs in BRAC1. Application of the method to 85 clinical cases revealed 22 deleterious mutations, 11 of which were novel. In summary, our studies demonstrate that the target enrichment combined with NGS method provides the accuracy, sensitivity, and high throughput for genetic testing for patients with high risk of hereditary or familial cancer.

More than 79,000 samples were subjected to HLA genotyping at 4-digit allelic level without ambiguities for HLA-A, -B, -C, DRB1 and DQB1 loci, with throughput up to 2068 samples per lane in a HiSeq flow cell (eight lanes per run), and cost reduced by 95% compared with that of Sanger-based typing. Two percent of randomly selected samples were quality control (QC) tested at 4-digit allelic level by the CMDP QC laboratory, yielded a concordance of 99.72%. These results demonstrate that NGS is a cost effective and valuable tool for HLA typing of registry donors.

Next-generation sequencing technology performs advantageously and effectively in genetic mapping and genome analysis of diverse genetic resources. Hence, we combined re-sequencing technology and a bin map strategy to construct an ultra-high-density bin map with thousands of bin markers to precisely map a quantitative trait locus. Results: In this study, we generated a linkage map containing 1,151,856 high quality SNPs between Mo17 and B73, which were verified in the maize intermated B73 xMo17 (IBM) Syn10 population. This resource is an excellent complement to existing maize genetic maps available in an online database (iPlant, http://data.maizecode.org/maize/qtl/syn10/). Moreover, in this population combined with the IBM Syn4 RIL population, we detected 135 QTLs for flowering time and plant height traits across the two populations. Eighteen known functional genes and twenty-five candidate genes for flowering time and plant height trait were fine-mapped into a 2.21-4.96 Mb interval. Map expansion and segregation distortion were also analyzed, and evidence for inadvertent selection of early flowering time in the process of mapping population development was observed. Furthermore, an updated integrated map with 1,151,856 high-quality SNPs, 2,916 traditional markers and 6,618 bin markers was constructed. The data were deposited into the iPlant Discovery Environment (DE), which provides a fundamental resource of genetic data for the maize genetic research community. Conclusions: Our findings provide basic essential genetic data for the maize genetic research community. An updated IBM Syn10 population and a reliable, verified high-quality SNP set between Mo17 and B73 will aid in future molecular breeding efforts.

The incidence of various PAH mutations differs among race and ethnicity. Here we report a spectrum of PAH mutations complied from 796 PKU patients from mainland China. The all 13 exons and adjacent intronic regions of the PAH gene were determined by next-generation sequencing. We identified 194 different mutations, of which 41 are not reported before. Several mutations reoccurred with high frequency including p.R243Q, p.EX6-96A > G, p.V399V, p.R241C, p.R111(star), p.Y356(star), p.R413P, and IVS4-1G > A.76.33% of mutations were localized in exons 3, 6, 7, 11, 12. We further compared the frequency of each mutation between populations in northern and southern China, and found significant differences in 19 mutations. Furthermore, we identified 101 mutations that are not reported before in Chinese population, our study thus broadens the mutational spectrum of Chinese PKU patients. Additionally, 41 novel mutations will expand and improve PAH mutation database. Finally, our study offers proof that NGS is effective, reduces screening times and costs, and facilitates the provision of appropriate genetic counseling for PKU patients.

Here we show that the DEAD-box helicase Ded1p oligomerizes in the cell and in vitro, and unwinds RNA as a trimer. Two protomers bind the single-stranded region of RNA substrates and load a third protomer to the duplex, which then separates the strands. ATP utilization differs between the strand-separating protomer and those bound to the single-stranded region. Binding of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4G to Ded1p interferes with oligomerization and thereby modulates unwinding activity and RNA affinity of the helicase. Our data reveal a strict division of labor between the Ded1p protomers in the oligomer. This mode of oligomerization fundamentally differs from other helicases. Oligomerization represents a previously unappreciated level of regulation for DEAD-box helicase activities.

Identification of cancer predisposition variants in apparently healthy individuals using a next-generation sequencing-based family genomics approach	HUMAN GENOMICS			English	Article						Cancer predisposition; Family genomics; Next-generation sequencing; Genomic variants	SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS; BREAST-CANCER; REPAIR DEFICIENCY; KABUKI SYNDROME; MUTATIONS; SUSCEPTIBILITY; PENETRANCE; DISEASE; GENES; EPIDEMIOLOGY	Cancer, like many common disorders, has a complex etiology, often with a strong genetic component and with multiple environmental factors contributing to susceptibility. A considerable number of genomic variants have been previously reported to be causative of, or associated with, an increased risk for various types of cancer. Here, we adopted a next-generation sequencing approach in 11 members of two families of Greek descent to identify all genomic variants with the potential to predispose family members to cancer. Cross-comparison with data from the Human Gene Mutation Database identified a total of 571 variants, from which 47 % were disease-associated polymorphisms, 26 % disease-associated polymorphisms with additional supporting functional evidence, 19 % functional polymorphisms with in vitro/laboratory or in vivo supporting evidence but no known disease association, 4 % putative disease-causing mutations but with some residual doubt as to their pathological significance, and 3 % disease-causing mutations. Subsequent analysis, focused on the latter variant class most likely to be involved in cancer predisposition, revealed two variants of prime interest, namely MSH2 c.2732T>A (p.L911R) and BRCA1 c.2955delC, the first of which is novel. KMT2D c.13895delC and c.1940C>A variants are additionally reported as incidental findings. The next-generation sequencing-based family genomics approach described herein has the potential to be applied to other types of complex genetic disorder in order to identify variants of potential pathological significance.

A detailed understanding of the genetic consequences imparted by the domestication process remains a key goal of evolutionary genomics. Results: We constructed the reference genome of bezoar and sequenced representative breeds of domestic goats to search for genomic changes that likely have accompanied goat domestication and breed formation. Thirteen copy number variation genes associated with coat color were identified in domestic goats, among which ASIP gene duplication contributes to the generation of light coat-color phenotype in domestic goats. Analysis of rapidly evolving genes identified genic changes underlying behavior-related traits, immune response and production-related traits. Conclusion: Based on the comparison studies of copy number variation genes and rapidly evolving genes between wild and domestic goat, our findings and methodology shed light on the genetic mechanism of animal domestication and will facilitate future goat breeding.

However, participation in colonoscopy and sensitivity of fecal heme for CRA are low. Methods: Microbiota metrics were determined by Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA genes amplified from DNA extracted from feces self-collected in RNAlater. Among fecal immunochemical test-positive (FIT+) participants, colonoscopically-defined normal versus CRA patients were compared by regression, permutation, and random forest plus leave-one-out methods. Findings: Of 95 FIT+ participants, 61 had successful fecal microbiota profiling and colonoscopy, identifying 24 completely normal patients, 20 CRA patients, 2 CRC patients, and 15 with other conditions. Phylum-level fecal community composition differed significantly between CRA and normal patients (permutation P = 0.02). Rank phylum-level abundance distinguished CRA from normal patients (area under the curve = 0.767, permutation P = 0.006). CRA prevalence was 59% in phylum-level cluster B versus 20% in cluster A (exact P = 0.01). Most of the difference reflected 3-fold higher median relative abundance of Proteobacteria taxa (Wilcoxon signed-rank P = 0.03, positive predictive value = 67%). Antibiotic exposure and other potential confounders did not affect the associations. Interpretation: If confirmed in larger, more diverse populations, fecal microbiota analysis might be employed to improve screening for CRA and ultimately to reduce mortality from CRC.

We use exome sequencing to analyse nonsynonymous single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) across the whole genome of 216 neovascular AMD cases and 1,553 controls. As a follow-up validation, we evaluate 3,772 neovascular AMD cases and 6,942 controls from five independent cohorts in the East Asian population. Here we show strong evidence of an association at a novel, missense SNV, rs7739323, which is located in the ubiquitin protein ligase E3D (UBE3D) gene (P-meta = 1.46 x 10(-9), odds ratio (OR) = 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.63-0.88). Furthermore, ablation of the UBE3D protein lead to an abnormal amount of pigment granules deposited in retinal pigment epithelium microvilli area and an abnormal response on electroretinography (ERG) in UBE3D(+/-) heterozygous mice. Our findings indicate that the ubiquitin-proteasome system may play a role in the pathogenesis of neovascular AMD.

Artificial selection during soybean domestication and improvement results in substantial phenotypic divergence between wild and cultivated soybeans. Strong selective pressure on beneficial phenotypes could cause nucleotide fixations in the founder population of soybean cultivars in quite a short time. Results: Analysis of available sequencing accessions estimates that similar to 5.3 million single nucleotide variations reach saturation in cultivars, and then similar to 9.8 million in soybean germplasm. Selective sweeps defined by loss of genetic diversity reveal 2,255 and 1,051 genes were involved in domestication and subsequent improvement, respectively. Both processes introduced similar to 0.1 million nucleotide fixations, which contributed to the divergence of wild and cultivated soybeans. Meta-analysis of reported quantitative trait loci (QTL) and selective signals with nucleotide fixation identifies a series of putative candidate genes responsible for 13 agronomically important traits. Nucleotide fixation mediated by artificial selection affected diverse molecular functions and biological reactions that associated with soybean morphological and physiological changes. Of them, plant-pathogen interactions are of particular relevance as selective nucleotide fixations happened in disease resistance genes, cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels and terpene synthases. Conclusions: Our analysis provides insights into the impacts of nucleotide fixation during soybean domestication and improvement, which would facilitate future QTL mapping and molecular breeding practice.

The recent publication of the first two termite genomes provides a unique comparative opportunity, particularly because the sequenced termites represent opposite ends of the social complexity spectrum. Zootermopsis nevadensis has simple colonies with totipotent workers that can develop into all castes (dispersing reproductives, nest-inheriting replacement reproductives, and soldiers). In contrast, the fungus-growing termite Macrotermes natalensis belongs to the higher termites and has very large and complex societies with morphologically distinct castes that are life-time sterile. Here we compare key characteristics of genomic architecture, focusing on genes involved in communication, immune defenses, mating biology and symbiosis that were likely important in termite social evolution. We discuss these in relation to what is known about these genes in the ants and outline hypothesis for further testing.

Although this excess can in principle be accounted for by the concept of transient hypermutability, a general mutational signature of concurrent MNS mutations has not so far been evident. Employing a dataset (N = 449) of concurrent double MNS mutations causing human inherited disease, we have identified just such a mutational signature: concurrently generated double MNS mutations exhibit a >twofold lower transition/transversion ratio (termed R-Ts/Tv) than independently generated de novoSNS mutations (<0.80 vs. 2.10; P = 2.69 x 10(-14)). We replicated this novel finding through a similar analysis employing two double MNS variant datasets with differing abundances of concurrent events (150,521 variants with both substitutions on the same haplotypic lineage vs. 94,875 variants whose component substitutions were on different haplotypic lineages) plus 5,430,874 SNS variants, all being derived from the whole-genome sequencing of seven Chinese individuals. Evaluation of the newly observed mutational signature in diverse contexts provides solid support for the postulated role of translesion synthesis DNA polymerases in transient hypermutability.

To better understand HCC pathogenesis at the molecular level and to uncover novel tumor-initiating events, we integrated RNA-seq and DNA-seq data derived from two pairs of HCC tissues. We found that BLCAP is novel editing gene in HCC and has over-editing expression in 40.1% HCCs compared to adjacent liver tissues. We then used RNA interference and gene transfection to assess the roles of BLCAP RNA editing in tumor proliferation. Our results showed that compared to the wild-type BLCAP gene, the RNA-edited BLCAP gene may stably promote cell proliferation (including cell growth, colony formation in vitro, and tumorigenicity in vivo) by enhancing the phosphorylation of AICT, mTOR, and MDM2 and inhibiting the phosphorylation of TP53. Our current results suggest that the RNA over-editing of BLCAP gene may serve as a novel potential driver in advanced HCC through activating AKT/mTOR signal pathway. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

But little attention was focused on them and only few centipede toxins were demonstrated with activity on ion channels. Therefore, more deep works are needed to understand the diversity of centipede venom. In the present study, we use peptidomics combined with cDNA library to uncover the diversity of centipede Scolopendra subspinipes mutilans L. Koch. 192 peptides were identified by LC-MS/MS and 79 precursors were deduced by cDNA library. Surprisingly, the signal peptides of centipede toxins were more complicated than any other animal toxins and even exhibited large differences in homologues. Meanwhile, a large number of variants generated by alternative cleavage sites were detected by mass spectra. Odd number of cystein (3, 5, 7) found in the mature peptides were seldom seen in peptide toxins. In additional, two novel cysteine frameworks (C-C-C-CCC, C-C-C-C-CC-CC) were identified from 16 different cysteine frameworks from centipede peptides. Only 29 precursors have clear targets, while others may provide a potential diversity function for centipede. These findings highlight the extensive diversity of centipede toxins and provide powerful tools to understand the capture and defense weapon of centipede. Biological significance Peptide toxins from venomous animal have attracted increasing attentions due to their extraordinary chemical and pharmacological diversity. Centipedes are one of the most used Chinese traditional medicines, but little was known about the active components. The venom of Scolopendra subspinipes mutilans L. Koch is first deeply analyzed in this work and most of peptides were never discovered before. Interestingly, the number and arrangement of cysteine showed a larger different to known peptide toxins such spider or scorpion toxins. Moreover, only 29 peptides from this centipede venom were identified with known function. It suggested that our work not only important to understand the composition of centipede venom, but also provide many valuable peptides for potential biological functions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

CDR3 sequencing-based immune repertoire can be closely associated with cancer prognosis and development. Identifying the specific interaction between the TCR and cellular antigens is important for developing novel immunotherapeutic approaches for the treatment of cancer. The rearranged TCR beta loci amplified using Vb- and Jb-specific primers by multi-PCR and sequenced using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) in liver cancers were compared with those of T cells from healthy adult peripheral blood and from adjacent liver tissue. The T-cell repertoires within each tumor show strong similarity to one another but are distinct from those of the circulating T-cell repertoire. In addition, our results demonstrate that there are significant differences in the T-cell repertoires of HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma), ICC (intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma), and MHC (mixed hepatocellular and cholangiocellular carcinoma). Furthermore, we found that the highly expanded clone (HEC) ratio in blood samples from liver cancer patients differed significantly from those in the blood of healthy adults and hepatitis patients (p < 0.001). The above results suggest that comparison of the T-cell repertoires of tissue and blood could be used to distinguish liver cancer patients from healthy adults and from hepatitis patients. In the future, the diversity of CDR3 sequences in liver cancer may prove to be a useful and novel biomarker for detecting aggressive tumors with high invasive or metastatic capacity.

Many genes responsible for ARNSHL have been identified or mapped. We previously mapped an ARNSHL locus at 17q12, herein designated DFNB99, in a consanguineous Chinese family. In this study, whole-exome sequencing revealed a homozygous missense mutation (c.1259G>A, p.Arg420Gln) in the gene-encoding transmembrane protein 132E (TMEM132E) as the causative variant. Immunofluorescence staining of the Organ of Corti showed Tmem132e highly expressed in murine inner hair cells. Furthermore, knockdown of the tmem132e ortholog in zebrafish affected the mechanotransduction of hair cells. Finally, wild-type human TMEM132E mRNA, but not the mRNA carrying the c.1259G>A mutation rescued the Tmem132e knockdown phenotype. We conclude that the variant in TMEM132E is the most likely cause of DFNB99.

In the present study, we sequenced the whole genome DNA methylation in these breeds to detect whether DNA methylation plays a role in determining the body mass of sheep by Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation - sequencing method. A high quality methylation map of Chinese Mongolian sheep was obtained in this study. We identified 399 different methylated regions located in 93 human orthologs, which were previously reported as body size related genes in human genome-wide association studies. We tested three regions in LTBP1, and DNA methylation of two CpG sites showed significant correlation with its RNA expression. Additionally, a particular set of differentially methylated windows enriched in the "development process" (GO: 0032502) was identified as potential candidates for association with body mass variation. Next, we validated small part of these windows in 5 genes; DNA methylation of SMAD1, TSC1 and AKT1 showed significant difference across breeds, and six CpG were significantly correlated with RNA expression. Interestingly, two CpG sites showed significant correlation with TSC1 protein expression. This study provides a thorough understanding of body size variation in sheep from an epigenetic perspective.

Methodology/Principal Findings We designed a capture array to mainly capture all the coding sequence (CDS) of 2,181 genes associated with 561 Mendelian diseases and conducted NGS to detect mutations. The accuracy of NGS was 99.95%, which was obtained by comparing the genotypes of selected loci between our method and SNP Array in four samples from normal human adults. We also tested the stability of the method using a sample from normal human adults. The results showed that an average of 97.79% and 96.72% of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the sample could be detected stably in a batch and different batches respectively. In addition, the method could detect various types of mutations. Some disease-causing mutations were detected in 69 clinical cases, including 62 SNVs, 14 insertions and deletions (Indels), 1 copy number variant (CNV), 1 microdeletion and 2 microduplications of chromosomes, of which 35 mutations were novel. Mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing or real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Conclusions/Significance Results of the evaluation showed that targeted NGS enabled to detect disease-causing mutations with high accuracy, stability, speed and throughput. Thus, the technology can be used for the clinical diagnosis of 561 Mendelian diseases.

Freedom and Responsibility in Synthetic Genomics: The Synthetic Yeast Project	GENETICS			English	Editorial Material						synthetic biology; ethics; governance; oversight; yeast	CHROMOSOME	First introduced in 2011, the Synthetic Yeast Genome (Sc2.0) Project is a large international synthetic genomics project that will culminate in the first eukaryotic cell (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) with a fully synthetic genome. With collaborators from across the globe and from a range of institutions spanning from do-it-yourself biology (DIYbio) to commercial enterprises, it is important that all scientists working on this project are cognizant of the ethical and policy issues associated with this field of research and operate under a common set of principles. In this commentary, we survey the current ethics and regulatory landscape of synthetic biology and present the Sc2.0 Statement of Ethics and Governance to which all members of the project adhere. This statement focuses on four aspects of the Sc2.0 Project: societal benefit, intellectual property, safety, and self-governance. We propose that such project-level agreements are an important, valuable, and flexible model of self-regulation for similar global, large-scale synthetic biology projects in order to maximize the benefits and minimize potential harms.

The Influence of the Autoimmunity-Associated Ancestral HLA Haplotype AH8.1 on the Human Gut Microbiota: A Cross-Sectional Study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SEGMENTED FILAMENTOUS BACTERIA; INTESTINAL MICROBIOTA; HUMAN MHC; DISEASE; GENES; SENSITIVITY; INDUCTION; GENOTYPE; TWINS	Multiple immune-related genes are encoded in the HLA complex on chromosome 6p21. The 8.1 ancestral haplotype (AH8.1) include the classical HLA alleles HLA-B*08:01 and HLA-DRB1*03: 01, and has been associated with a large number of autoimmune diseases, but the underlying mechanisms for this association are largely unknown. Given the recently established links between the gut microbiota and inflammatory diseases, we hypothesized that the AH8.1 influences the host gut microbial community composition. To study this further, healthy individuals were selected from the Norwegian Bone Marrow Donor Registry and categorized as either I. AH8.1 homozygote (n=34), II. AH8.1 heterozygote (n=38), III. Non AH8.1 heterozygote or IV. HLA-DRB1 homozygote but non AH8.1 (n=15). Bacterial DNA from stool samples were subjected to sequencing of the V3-V5 region of the 16S rRNA gene on the 454 Life Sciences platform and data analyzed using Mothur and QIIME. The results showed that the abundances of different taxa were highly variable within all pre-defined AH8.1 genotype groups. Using univariate non-parametric statistics, there were no differences regarding alpha or beta diversity between AH8.1 carriers (categories I and II) and non-carriers (categories III and IV), however four different taxa (Prevotellaceae, Clostridium XVIII, Coprococcus, Enterorhabdus) had nominally significant lower abundances in AH8.1 carriers than non-carriers. After including possible confounders in a multivariate linear regression, only the two latter genera remained significantly associated. In conclusion, the overall contribution of the AH8.1 haplotype to the variation in gut microbiota profile of stool in the present study was small.

Thirty-eight individuals were subjected to WES. Causative variants were searched among single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertion/deletion variants (indels) and whenever no potential candidate emerged, copy number variant (CNV) analysis was performed. Variants or regions harboring a candidate variant were prioritized and segregation of the variant with the disease was further assessed using Sanger sequencing in case of SNVs and indels, and quantitative PCR (qPCR) for CNVs. SNV and indel analysis led to the identification of a previously reported mutation in PRPH2. Two additional mutations linked to different forms of retinal dystrophies were identified in two families: a known frameshift deletion in RPGR, a gene responsible for X-linked retinitis pigmentosa and p.Ser163Arg in C1QTNF5 associated with Late-Onset Retinal Degeneration. A novel heterozygous deletion spanning the entire region of PRPF31 was also identified in the affected members of a fourth family, which was confirmed with qPCR. This study allowed the identification of the genetic cause of the retinal dystrophy and the establishment of a correct diagnosis in four families, including a large heterozygous deletion in PRPF31, typically considered one of the pitfalls of this method. Since all findings in this study are restricted to known genes, we propose that targeted sequencing using gene-panel is an optimal first approach for the genetic screening and that once known genetic causes are ruled out, WES might be used to uncover new genes involved in inherited retinal dystrophies.

Both blends were well fermented and the presence of acacia gum modified the intestinal fermentation of the blend from a boosted fermentation into a gradual one in the complete colon. Confirmation of the gradual fermentation was obtained by analysis of the pH profile, measurement of the residual acacia gum fractions in the colon and by the increased expression of specific catabolic enzymes. Both blends increased the total amount of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs; +42 mmol/L), propionate (+26 mmol/L) and butyrate (+9 mmol/L) and showed bifidogenic properties. Metagenomic Illumina sequencing confirmed that the blends exerted a diverse modulating activity in the different areas of the colon. Long-term repeated administration of the prebiotic blends is needed to reach gradual changes in the gut microbial community structure and activity. The partial substitution of FOS and inulin by acacia gum slowed the speed of the fermentation of the blend. In humans, this may translate into benefits for gut health, allowing for incorporation of higher amounts of fibre into the diet. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Elucidating steroid alkaloid biosynthesis in Veratrum californicum: production of verazine in Sf9 cells	PLANT JOURNAL			English	Article						verazine; Veratrum californicum; California corn lily; Haystack; steroid alkaloids; cyclopamine	POPPY PAPAVER-SOMNIFERUM; MORPHINE BIOSYNTHESIS; TERATOGENIC COMPOUNDS; OPIUM POPPY; GRANDIFLORUM; CYCLOPAMINE; EXPRESSION; DURAND; INHIBITION; GENES	Steroid alkaloids have been shown to elicit a wide range of pharmacological effects that include anticancer and antifungal activities. Understanding the biosynthesis of these molecules is essential to bioengineering for sustainable production. Herein, we investigate the biosynthetic pathway to cyclopamine, a steroid alkaloid that shows promising antineoplastic activities. Supply of cyclopamine is limited, as the current source is solely derived from wild collection of the plant Veratrum californicum. To elucidate the early stages of the pathway to cyclopamine, we interrogated a V.californicum RNA-seq dataset using the cyclopamine accumulation profile as a predefined model for gene expression with the pattern-matching algorithm Haystack. Refactoring candidate genes in Sf9 insect cells led to discovery of four enzymes that catalyze the first six steps in steroid alkaloid biosynthesis to produce verazine, a predicted precursor to cyclopamine. Three of the enzymes are cytochromes P450 while the fourth is a -aminobutyrate transaminase; together they produce verazine from cholesterol. Significance Statement The first four enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the steroid alkaloid verazine, a predicted precursor to the antineoplastic cyclopamine in Veratrum californicum, were discovered: cholesterol 22-hydroxylase, 22-hydroxycholesterol 26-hydroxylase/oxidase, 22-hydroxycholesterol-26-al transaminase, and 22-hydroxy-26-aminocholesterol 22-oxidase. The pathway to verazine has been refactored in Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells.

Recent discovery of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as critical regulators in normal and disease development provides new clues for delineating the molecular regulation in male germ cell development. However, few functional lncRNAs have been characterized to date. A major limitation in studying lncRNA in male germ cell development is the absence of germ cell-specific lncRNA annotation. Current lncRNA annotations are assembled by transcriptome data from heterogeneous tissue sources; specific germ cell transcript information of various developmental stages is therefore under-represented, which may lead to biased prediction or fail to identity important germ cell-specific lncRNAs. GermlncRNA provides the first comprehensive web-based and open-access lncRNA catalogue for three key male germ cell stages, including type A spermatogonia, pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids. This information has been developed by integrating male germ transcriptome resources derived from RNA-Seq, tiling microarray and GermSAGE. Characterizations on lncRNA-associated regulatory features, potential coding gene and microRNA targets are also provided. Search results from GermlncRNA can be exported to Galaxy for downstream analysis or downloaded locally. Taken together, GermlncRNA offers a new avenue to better understand the role of lncRNAs and associated targets during spermatogenesis.

However, current knowledge of molecular mechanisms involved in plant resistance to Z. tritici and Z. tritici virulence factors is far from being complete. The present work investigated the proteome of leaf apoplastic fluid with emphasis on both host wheat and Z. tritici during the compatible and incompatible interactions. Results: The proteomics analysis revealed rapid host responses to the biotrophic growth, including enhanced carbohydrate metabolism, apoplastic defenses and stress, and cell wall reinforcement, might contribute to resistance. Compatibility between the host and the pathogen was associated with inactivated plant apoplastic responses as well as fungal defenses to oxidative stress and perturbation of plant cell wall during the initial biotrophic stage, followed by the strong induction of plant defenses during the necrotrophic stage. To study the role of anti-oxidative stress in Z. tritici pathogenicity in depth, a YAP1 transcription factor regulating antioxidant expression was deleted and showed the contribution to anti-oxidative stress in Z. tritici, but was not required for pathogenicity. This result suggests the functional redundancy of antioxidants in the fungus. Conclusions: The data demonstrate that incompatibility is probably resulted from the proteome-level activation of host apoplastic defenses as well as fungal incapability to adapt to stress and interfere with host cell at the biotrophic stage of the interaction.

Genetic evaluations of patients with IRD might result in better clinical assessments and better management of patients. OBJECTIVE To determine the genetic lesions with phenotypic correlations in patients with diverse autosomal recessive IRD using next-generation sequencing. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A cohort of 20 Chinese families affected with autosomal recessive IRD were recruited (with data on their detailed family history and on their clinical condition). To identify disease-causing mutations in the patients, the targeted sequence capture of IRD-relevant genes using 2 in-house-designed microarrays, followed by next-generation sequencing, was performed. Bioinformatics annotation, intrafamilial cosegregation analyses, in silico analyses, and functional analyses were subsequently conducted for the variants identified by next-generation sequencing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The results of detailed clinical evaluations, the identification of disease-causing mutations, and the clinical diagnosis. RESULTS Homozygous and biallelic variants were identified in 11 of the 20 families (55%) as very likely disease-causing mutations, including a total of 17 alleles, of which 12 are novel. The 17 alleles identified here include 3 missense, 6 nonsense, 4 frameshift, and 4 splice site mutations. In addition, we found biallelic RP1 mutations in a patient with cone-rod dystrophy, which was not previously correlated with RP1 mutations. Moreover, the identification of pathogenic mutations in 3 families helped to refine their clinical diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, to our knowledge, many mutations identified in those known loci for autosomal recessive IRD are novel. Specific RP1 mutations may correlate with cone-rod dystrophy. Genetic evaluations with targeted next-generation sequencing might result in a better clinical diagnosis and a better clinical assessment and, therefore, should be recommended for such patients.

At present, it includes tree shrews (Scandentia), flying lemurs (Dermoptera) and primates (Primates). Here, a phylogenomic dataset containing 1912 exons from 22 representative mammals was compiled to investigate the phylogenetic relationships within this group. Phylogenetic analyses and hypothesis testing suggested that tree shrews can be classified as a sister group to Primates or to Glires or even as a basal clade within Euarchontoglires. Further analyses of both modified and original previously published datasets found that the phylogenetic position of tree shrews is unstable. We also found that two of three exonic indels reported as synapomorphies of Euarchonta in a previous study do not unambiguously support the monophyly of such a clade. Therefore, the monophyly of both Euarchonta and Sundatheria (Dermoptera + Scandentia) are suspect. Molecular dating and divergence rate analyses suggested that the ancestor of Euarchontoglires experienced a rapid divergence, which may cause the unresolved position of tree shrews even using the whole genomic data.

Reversible alterations in the amount of mtDNA occur in response to stress suggesting that control over the amount of mtDNA is involved in stress-related diseases including major depressive disorder (MDD). Using low-coverage sequence data from 10,442 Chinese women to compute the normalized numbers of reads mapping to the mitochondrial genome as a proxy for the amount of mtDNA, we identified two loci that contribute to mtDNA levels: one within the TFAM gene on chromosome 10 (rs11006126, p value = 8.73 x 10(-28), variance explained = 1.90%) and one over the CDK6 gene on chromosome 7 (rs445, p value = 6.03 x 10(-16), variance explained = 0.50%). Both loci replicated in an independent cohort. CDK6 is thus a new molecule involved in the control of mtDNA. We identify increased rates of heteroplasmy in women with MDD, and show from an experimental paradigm using mice that the increase is likely due to stress. Furthermore, at least one heteroplasmic variant is significantly associated with changes in the amount of mtDNA (position 513, p value = 3.27 x 10(-9), variance explained = 0.48%) suggesting site-specific heteroplasmy as a possible link between stress and increase in amount of mtDNA. These findings indicate the involvement of mitochondrial genome copy number and sequence in an organism's response to stress.

In fungi, DNA methylation has various effects on diverse biological processes. However, its function in the sexual development of fungi remains unclear. Cordyceps militaris, readily performs sexual reproduction and thus provides a remarkably rich model for understanding epigenetic processes in sexual development. Here, we surveyed the methylome of C. militaris at single-base resolution to assess DNA methylation patterns during sexual development using genomic bisulfite sequencing (BS-Seq). The results showed that approximately 0.4% of cytosines are methylated, similar to the DNA methylation level (0.39 %) during asexual development. Importantly, we found that DNA methylation in the fungi undergoes global reprogramming during fungal development. Moreover, RNA-Seq analysis indicated that the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) have no correlation with the genes that have roles during fungal sexual development in C. militaris. These results provide a comprehensive characterization of DNA methylation in the sexual development of C. militaris, which will contribute to future investigations of epigenetics in fungi.

The purpose of this study was to determine the origin of the contralateral breast cancer (either dependent or independent of the index tumor). Here, we used ultra-deep whole-exome sequencing and array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to study four paired samples of BBCs with different tumor subtypes and time intervals between the developments of each tumor. We used two paired primary breast tumors and corresponding metastatic liver lesions as the control. We tested the origin independent nature of BBC in three ways: mutational concordance, mutational signature clustering, and clonality analysis using copy number profiles. We found that the paired BBC samples had near-zero concordant mutation rates, which were much lower than those of the paired primary/metastasis samples. The results of a mutational signature analysis also suggested that BBCs are independent of one another. A clonality analysis using aCGH data further revealed that paired BBC samples was clonally independent, in contrast to clonal related origin found for paired primary/metastasis samples. Our preliminary findings show that BBCs in Han Chinese women are origin independent and thus should be treated separately.

Recently, the requirements for food safety and food integrity have increased with improved quality of life. Methodologies regarding food authentication based on DNA analysis are more commonly being used. With the increasing number of vegetarians, searching for markers for blind identification across kingdom species, such as an ingredient of animal origin in vegetarian food, would be valuable and attractive. Using bioinformatic analysis of an existing data source composed of 481 ultraconserved sequences, we selected 6 new candidate DNA segments that exist in most vertebrates but that do not exist in plants. Then, primers were designed for all of the candidate DNA markers, and DNA samples isolated from cow, pig, chicken, duck, soy bean, rice, pepper, wheat, sunflower and colza were amplified using each primer pair. None of the plant DNA samples generated a PCR product, while the DNA samples of animal origin were amplified successfully using 5 of the candidate segment primers; the 6th segment primer failed to amplify the DNA and was discarded. Moreover, a simulation experiment containing a plant product contaminated by an animal component indicated that the candidate DNA markers can be used for the rapid detection of animal adulterants in vegetarian products with a promising 5% detection limit. The identified candidate DNA markers for the blind identification of animal adulteration in vegetarian food may be highly desirable in the vegetarian food market, and these markers may facilitate the study of molecular technology for food authentication.

Concept and design of a genome-wide association genotyping array tailored for transplantation-specific studies	GENOME MEDICINE			English	Article							KIDNEY-TRANSPLANTATION; SNP ARRAY; GENE; POLYMORPHISMS; RECIPIENTS; POPULATION; MISMATCH; MANAGEMENT; IMPUTATION; REJECTION	Background: In addition to HLA genetic incompatibility, non-HLA difference between donor and recipients of transplantation leading to allograft rejection are now becoming evident. We aimed to create a unique genome-wide platform to facilitate genomic research studies in transplant-related studies. We designed a genome-wide genotyping tool based on the most recent human genomic reference datasets, and included customization for known and potentially relevant metabolic and pharmacological loci relevant to transplantation. Methods: We describe here the design and implementation of a customized genome-wide genotyping array, the 'TxArray', comprising approximately 782,000 markers with tailored content for deeper capture of variants across HLA, KIR, pharmacogenomic, and metabolic loci important in transplantation. To test concordance and genotyping quality, we genotyped 85 HapMap samples on the array, including eight trios. Results: We show low Mendelian error rates and high concordance rates for HapMap samples (average parent-parent-child heritability of 0.997, and concordance of 0.996). We performed genotype imputation across autosomal regions, masking directly genotyped SNPs to assess imputation accuracy and report an accuracy of >0.962 for directly genotyped SNPs. We demonstrate much higher capture of the natural killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) region versus comparable platforms. Overall, we show that the genotyping quality and coverage of the TxArray is very high when compared to reference samples and to other genome-wide genotyping platforms. Conclusions: We have designed a comprehensive genome-wide genotyping tool which enables accurate association testing and imputation of ungenotyped SNPs, facilitating powerful and cost-effective large-scale genotyping of transplant-related studies.

Based on genome-wide profile analysis, we detected differential mRNA of maize genes. Some of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were predicted to be potential candidates of maize ear development. Several well-known genes were found with reported mutant analyses, such as, compact plant2 (ct2), zea AGAMOUS homolog1 (zag1), bearded ear (bde), and silky1 (si1). MicroRNAs such as microRNA156 were predicted to target genes involved in maize ear development. Antisense transcripts were widespread throughout all the four stages, and are suspected to play important roles in maize ear development. Thus, identification and characterization of important genes and regulators at all the four developmental stages will contribute to an improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for maize ear development.

Whole-exome sequencing of a single Italian proband affected by non-syndromic HL identified a novel missense variant within the PRPS1 gene (NM_002764.3:c.337G>T (p.A113S)) segregating with post-lingual, bilateral, progressive deafness in the proband's family. Defects in this gene, encoding the phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1 (PRS-I) enzyme, determine either X-linked syndromic conditions associated with hearing impairment (eg, Arts syndrome and Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type X-5) or non-syndromic HL (DFNX1). A subsequent screening of the entire PRPS1 gene in 16 unrelated probands from X-linked deaf families led to the discovery of two additional missense variants (c.343A>G (p.M115V) and c.925G>T (p.V309F)) segregating with hearing impairment, and associated with mildly-symptomatic peripheral neuropathy. All three variants result in a marked reduction (>60%) of the PRS-I activity in the patients' erythrocytes, with c.343A>G (p.M115V) and c.925G>T (p.V309F) affecting more severely the enzyme function. Our data significantly expand the current spectrum of pathogenic variants in PRPS1, confirming that they are associated with a continuum disease spectrum, thus stressing the importance of functional studies and detailed clinical investigations for genotype-phenotype correlation.

METHODS: We developed a strategy to obtain the full embryonic genome for a beta-thalassemia-carrier couple to have a healthy second baby. We carried out sequencing for single blastomere cells and the family trio and further developed the analysis pipeline, including recovery of the missing alleles, removal of the majority of errors, and phasing of the embryonic genome. RESULTS: The final accuracy for homozygous and heterozygous single-nucleotide polymorphisms reached 99.62% and 98.39%, respectively. The aneuploidies of embryos were detected as well. Based on the comprehensive embryonic genome, we effectively performed wholegenome mendelian disorder diagnosis and human leukocyte antigen matching tests. CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective study in beta-thalassemia family demonstrates a method for embryo genome recovery through single-cell sequencing, which permits detection of genetic variations in preimplantation genetic diagnosis. It shows the potential of single-cell sequencing technology in preimplantation genetic diagnosis clinical practices.

GxE Interactions between FOXO Genotypes and Tea Drinking Are Significantly Associated with Cognitive Disability at Advanced Ages in China	JOURNALS OF GERONTOLOGY SERIES A-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						FOXO genotypes; Tea drinking; GxE interactions; Cognitive disability; Oldest old	OLDEST-OLD CHINESE; GREEN TEA; HUMAN LONGEVITY; CONSUMPTION; CANCER; RISK; SINGAPORE; CELLS	Logistic regression analysis based on data from 822 Han Chinese oldest old aged 92+ demonstrated that interactions between carrying FOXO1A-266 or FOXO3-310 or FOXO3-292 and tea drinking at around age 60 or at present time were significantly associated with lower risk of cognitive disability at advanced ages. Associations between tea drinking and reduced cognitive disability were much stronger among carriers of the genotypes of FOXO1A-266 or FOXO3-310 or FOXO3-292 compared with noncarriers, and it was reconfirmed by analysis of three-way interactions across FOXO genotypes, tea drinking at around age 60, and at present time. Based on prior findings from animal and human cell models, we postulate that intake of tea compounds may activate FOXO gene expression, which in turn may positively affect cognitive function in the oldest old population. Our empirical findings imply that the health benefits of particular nutritional interventions, including tea drinking, may, in part, depend upon individual genetic profiles.

A number of genes responsible for Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) may also cause RP when they are mutated. Our previous study revealed that variants in the most frequently mutated nine exons accounted for approximately half of the mutations detected in a cohort of patients with LCA. The aim of the present study was to detect mutations in LCA-associated genes in patients with RP using two different strategies. Sanger sequencing was used to screen mutations in the nine exons in 293 patients with RP and exome sequencing was used to detect variants in 12 LCA-associated genes in 157 of the 293 patients with RP and then to validate the variants by Sanger sequencing. Potential pathogenic mutations were identified in four patients with early onset RP, including homozygous CRB1 mutations in two patients, compound heterozygous CRB1 mutations in one patient and compound heterozygous CEP290 mutations in one patient. The present study indicated that mutations in CEP290 may also be associated with RP but not with LCA. With the exception of CEP290, the remaining 11 genes known to be associated with LCA but not with RP are unlikely to be a common cause of RP.

Over the past few years, a number of studies have been conducted regarding themophiles, especially using the omics strategies. This review provides a systematic view of the survival physiology of thermophiles from an "omics" perspective, which suggests that the adaptive ability of thermophiles is based on a cooperative mode with multi-dimensional regulations integrating genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics.

To conduct a comprehensive research study on root caries, we utilized 454-pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene libraries and quantitative PCR to compare supra-gingival bacterial communities from healthy sites and carious sites of 21 patients with root caries (Patient-controls and Patient-cases) and the sites of 21 healthy individuals (Healthy-controls) from two nursing homes. Healthy-controls and Patient-cases showed no significant differences in terms of biomass, species richness, and species diversity. However, as for beta diversity based on either community membership metric (unweighted UniFrac) or community structure metric (weighted UniFrac), Healthy-controls and Patient-cases were clearly distinguished from each other, appearing more variable in the community membership and structure in root caries microbiome but relatively conserved in the health microbiome. The Patient-controls group was at an intermediate stage between Healthy-controls and Patient-cases, but was more inclined to the former. Demonstrated in both relative abundance and prevalence of species in health and root caries, Propionibacterium acidifaciens, Streptococcus mutans, Olsenella profusa, Prevotella multisaccharivorax, and Lactobacillus crispatus were found to be most associated with root caries, whereas Delftia acidovorans, Bacteroidetes[G-2] sp., Lachnospiraceae[G-3] sp., and Prevotella intermedia are most associated with health. Our study provides a basis for further elucidating the microbial etiology of root caries in the elderly.

However, no conclusive findings regarding the non-RET genetic events have been reported. This is the first study, to our knowledge, examining genomic alterations in matched MEN2A-associated tumors. We performed exome sequencing and SNP array analysis of matched MEN2A tumors and germline DNA. Somatic alterations were validated in an independent set of patients using Sanger sequencing. Genes of functional interest were further evaluated. The germline RET mutation was found in all MEN2A-component tumors. Thirty-two somatic mutations were identified in the nine MEN2A-associated tumors, of which 28 (87.5%) were point mutations and 4 (12.5%) were small insertions, duplications, or deletions. We sequenced all the mutations as well as coding sequence regions of the 12 genes in an independent sample set including 35 medullary thyroid cancers (20 MEN2A) and 34 PCCs (22 MEN2A), but found no recurrent mutations. Recurrent alterations were found in 13 genes with either mutations or alterations in copy number, including an EIF4G1 mutation (p. E1147V). Mutation of EIF4G1 led to increased cell proliferation and RET/MAPK phosphorylation, while knockdown of EIF4G1 led to reduced cell proliferation and RET/MAPK phosphorylation in TT, MZ-CRC1, and PC-12 cells. We found fewer somatic mutations in endocrine tumors compared with non-endocrine tumors. RET was the primary driver in MEN2A-associated tumors. However, low-frequency alterations such as EIF4G1 might participate in MEN2A-associated tumorigenesis, possibly by regulating the activity of the RET pathway.

Recent work validated that using room temperature for the storage of nucleic acids is possible if the samples are completely protected from water and oxygen. Here, we conducted accelerated aging and real-time degradation studies to evaluate the new technology DNAshell and RNAshell, which preserves DNA and RNA at room temperature, including the DNA and RNA yield, purity, and integrity. DNA and RNA solutions are dried in the presence of stabilizers in stainless steel minicapsules, then redissolved after different time points of heating and storing at room temperature. Results show that DNAshell and RNAshell ensure the safe storage of nucleic acids at room temperature for long periods of time, and that the quality of these nucleic acids is suitable for common downstream analysis.

To better understand the molecular characterization of Slc7a11 and the expression patterns in skin of white versus brown alpaca (lama paco), we cloned the full length coding sequence (CDS) of alpaca Slc7a11 gene and analyzed the expression patterns using Real Time PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The full length CDS of 1512 bp encodes a 503 amino acid polypeptide. Sequence analysis showed that alpaca xCT contains 12 transmembrane regions consistent with the highly conserved amino acid permease (AA_permease_2) domain similar to other vertebrates. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis revealed that alpaca xCT had the highest identity and shared the same branch with Camelus fetus. Real Time PCR and Western blotting suggested that xCT was expressed at significantly high levels in brown alpaca skin, and transcripts and protein possessed the same expression pattern in white and brown alpaca skins. Additionally, immunohistochemical analysis further demonstrated that xCT staining was robustly increased in the matrix and root sheath of brown alpaca skin compared with that of white. These results suggest that Slc7a11 functions in alpaca coat color regulation and offer essential information for further exploration on the role of Slc7a11 in melanogenesis. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It was obtained for the first time as a new natural product from a mangrove actinomycete Streptomyces qinglanensis 172205, during the course of searching for anti-cancer compounds from marine microbes. PreQ(0) base showed anti-HeLa (IC50 = 62.0 mu g/ml) and anti-HepG2 (IC50 = 80.6 mu g/ml) activities, higher cytotoxicity than the positive control, fluorouracil. Furthermore, it exhibited weak alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity, but no obvious antimicrobial and A beta(1-42) fibrillation inhibitory activities. In silico analysis of the genome of the strain 172205 revealed a putative biosynthetic gene cluster directing the biosynthesis of PreQ(0) base. The gene cluster only contained three Open Reading Frames (ORFs), queC, queD and queE. The absence of the key gene queF encoding 7-cyano-7-deazaguanine reductase catalyzing PreQ(0) base to PreQ(1) base suggested that the strain only has the capacity of accumulation of PreQ(0) base as a metabolite, consistent with our observation in chemical identification.

Many tools based on DNA re-sequencing exist for identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms, small insertions and deletions (indels) as well as large deletions. However, these approaches consistently display a substantial bias against the recovery of complex structural variants and novel sequence in individual genomes and do not provide interpretation information such as the annotation of ancestral state and formation mechanism. Findings: We present a novel approach implemented in a single software package, AsmVar, to discover, genotype and characterize different forms of structural variation and novel sequence from population-scale de novo genome assemblies up to nucleotide resolution. Application of AsmVar to several human de novo genome assemblies captures a wide spectrum of structural variants and novel sequences present in the human population in high sensitivity and specificity. Conclusions: Our method provides a direct solution for investigating structural variants and novel sequences from de novo genome assemblies, facilitating the construction of population-scale pan-genomes. Our study also highlights the usefulness of the de novo assembly strategy for definition of genome structure.

Identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is important for quantification of methylation levels and for study of allele-specific epigenetic events such as imprinting. However, SNP calling in such data is complex and time consuming. Here, we present an ultrafast and memory-efficient package named BS-SNPer for the exploration of SNP sites from BS-Seq data. Compared with Bis-SNP, a popular BS-Seq specific SNP caller, BS-SNPer is over 100 times faster and uses less memory.

Material and Methods: Pooled subgingival plaque and saliva samples were collected from 10 AgP patients and 10 of their first-degree blood relatives with chronic periodontitis. DNA amplicons of the V1-V3 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene were generated, and were subjected to 454-pyrosequencing. Results: In subgingival plaque, the unweighted UniFrac distances between family members were significantly lower than those in unrelated participants (p = 0.039). Compared with the relatives, the microbiota of subgingival plaque and saliva from AgP patients revealed significantly lower taxonomic diversity. High relative abundance of Porphyromonas gingivalis (about 35.88%) was detected in subgingival plaque from AgP patients. The relative abundance of P. gingivalis and Red complex pathogens (P. gingivalis, Treponema denticola and Tannerella forsythia) in the subgingival plaque and saliva samples from the same individual were significantly correlated in AgP patients (rho= 0.687 and 0.678, respectively). Conclusions: There is a kinship in the phylogenetic architecture of microbiota among Chinese AgP patients and their family members. P. gingivalis might be a predominant pathogen in these Chinese AgP patients.

Previous published results focused on genetic components through genome-wide association studies that just interpret this disease to some extent. Recently, two research groups published metagenome-wide association studies (MGWAS) result that found meta-biomarkers related with type 2 diabetes. However, One key problem of analyzing genomic data is that how to deal with the ultra-high dimensionality of features. From a statistical viewpoint it is challenging to filter true factors in high dimensional data. Various methods and techniques have been proposed on this issue, which can only achieve limited prediction performance and poor interpretability. New statistical procedure with higher performance and clear interpretability is appealing in analyzing high dimensional data. To address this problem, we apply an excellent statistical variable selection procedure called iterative sure independence screening to gene profiles that obtained from metagenome sequencing, and 48/24 meta-markers were selected in Chinese/European cohorts as predictors with 0.97/0.99 accuracy in AUC (area under the curve), which showed a better performance than other model selection methods, respectively. These results demonstrate the power and utility of data mining technologies within the large-scale and ultra-high dimensional genomic-related dataset for diagnostic and predictive markers identifying.

In this report, a genomic study was conducted to understand this species at molecular level. Methods: After blood meal on a B. pahangi-harbouring cat, the Aedes togoi mosquitoes were maintained to harvest infective third stage larvae, which were then injected into male Mongolian gerbils. Subsequently, adult B. pahangi were obtained from the infected gerbil for genomic DNA extraction. Sequencing and subsequently, construction of genomic libraries were performed. This was followed by genomic analyses and gene annotation analysis. By using archived protein sequences of B. malayi and a few other nematodes, clustering of gene orthologs and phylogenetics were conducted. Results: A total of 9687 coding genes were predicted. The genome of B. pahangi shared high similarity to that B. malayi genome, particularly genes annotated to fundamental processes. Nevertheless, 166 genes were considered to be unique to B. pahangi, which may be responsible for the distinct properties of B. pahangi as compared to other filarial nematodes. In addition, 803 genes were deduced to be derived from Wolbachia, an endosymbiont bacterium, with 44 of these genes intercalate into the nematode genome. Conclusions: The reporting of B. pahangi draft genome contributes to genomic archive. Albeit with high similarity to B. malayi genome, the B. pahangi-unique genes found in this study may serve as new focus to study differences in virulence, vector selection and host adaptability among different Brugia spp.	[Lau, Yee-Ling; Fong, Mun-Yik] Univ Malaya, Fac Med, Dept Parasitol, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Lee, Wenn-Chyau] ASTAR, Singapore Immunol Network SIgN, Singapore 138648, Singapore; [Xia, Jinquan; Zhang, GuiPing] BGI Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, Peoples R China; [Razali, Rozaimi; Anwar, Arif] Univ Malaya, Sengen HIR, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia	Lau, YL (reprint author), Univ Malaya, Fac Med, Dept Parasitol, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.	lauyeeling@um.edu.my	FONG, MUN YIK/B-5443-2010; Lau, Yee Ling/C-6996-2009	Lau, Yee Ling/0000-0002-2037-2165	University of Malaya High Impact Research (HIR) Grant UM-MOHE from the Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia [UM.C/HIR/MOHE/MED/16]	This research project was supported by University of Malaya High Impact Research (HIR) Grant UM-MOHE (UM.C/HIR/MOHE/MED/16) from the Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia.

The majority of these proteins were not identified in a recent proteome survey. Neither protein detection nor the analysis of transcriptomic data based on RNA-seq data for three liver cancer cell lines identified any expression products. Extensive investigation into DEFB transcripts in over 70 cell lines offered similar results. This fact naturally begs the question Why are DEFB genes scarcely expressed? After examining DEFB gene annotation and the physicochemical properties of its protein products, we postulated that regulatory elements could play a key role in the resultant poor transcription of DEFB genes. Four regions containing DEFB genes and six adjacent regions on chromosomes 6, 8, and 20 were carefully investigated using The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) information, such as that of DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs), transcription factors (TFs), and histone modifications. The results revealed that the intensities of these ENCODE features were globally weaker than those in the adjacent regions. Impressively, DEFB-related regions on chromosomes 6 and 8 containing several non-DEFB genes had lower ENCODE feature intensities, indicating that the absence of DEFB mRNAs might not depend on the gene family but may be reliant upon gene location and chromatin structure.

Here, we present an open source software tool, termed IPeak, a peptide identification pipeline that is designed to combine the Percolator post-processing algorithm and multi-search strategy to enhance the sensitivity of peptide identifications without compromising accuracy. IPeak provides a graphical user interface (GUI) as well as a command-line interface, which is implemented in JAVA and can work on all three major operating system platforms: Windows, Linux/Unix and OS X. IPeak has been designed to work with the mzIdentML standard from the Proteomics Standards Initiative (PSI) as an input and output, and also been fully integrated into the associated mzidLibrary project, providing access to the overall pipeline, as well as modules for calling Percolator on individual search engine result files. The integration thus enables IPeak (and Percolator) to be used in conjunction with any software packages implementing the mzIdentML data standard. IPeak is freely available and can be downloaded under an Apache 2.0 license at https://code.google.com/p/mzidentml-lib/.

Here, we examined poultry specimens from live bird markets linked to human H7N9 infection in Hangzhou, China. Metagenomic sequencing revealed mixed subtypes (H5, H7, H9, N1, N2, and N9). Subsequently, AIV subtypes H5N9, H7N9, and H9N2 were isolated. Evolutionary analysis showed that the hemagglutinin gene of the novel H5N9 virus originated from A/Muscovy duck/Vietnam/LBM227/2012 (H5N1), which belongs to clade 2.3.2.1. The neuraminidase gene of the novel H5N9 virus originated from human-infective A/Hangzhou/1/2013 (H7N9). The six internal genes were similar to those of other H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2 virus strains. The virus harbored the PQRERRRKR/GL motif characteristic of highly pathogenic AIVs at the HA cleavage site. Receptor-binding experiments demonstrated that the virus binds alpha-2,3 sialic acid but not alpha-2,6 sialic acid. Identically, pathogenicity experiments also showed that the virus caused low mortality rates in mice. This newly isolated H5N9 virus is a highly pathogenic reassortant virus originating from H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2 subtypes. Live bird markets represent a potential transmission risk to public health and the poultry industry. IMPORTANCE This investigation confirms that the novel H5N9 subtype avian influenza A virus is a reassortant strain originating from H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2 subtypes and is totally different from the H5N9 viruses reported before. The novel H5N9 virus acquired a highly pathogenic H5 gene and an N9 gene from human-infecting subtype H7N9 but caused low mortality rates in mice. Whether this novel H5N9 virus will cause human infections from its avian host and become a pandemic subtype is not known yet. It is therefore imperative to assess the risk of emergence of this novel reassortant virus with potential transmissibility to public health.

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), genome-wide analysis of methylation has only recently been used. For a better understanding of hepatocarcinogenesis, we applied an even higher resolution analysis of the promoter methylome to identify previously unknown regions and genes differentially methylated in HCC. Results: Optimized liquid hybridization capture-based bisulfite sequencing (LHC-BS) was developed to quantitatively analyze 1.86 million CpG sites in individual samples from eight pairs of HCC and adjacent tissues. By linking the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in promoters to the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we identified 12 DMR-associated genes. We further utilized Illumina MiSeq combining the bisulfite sequencing PCR approach to validate the 12 candidate genes. Analysis of an additional 78 HCC pairs on the Illumina MiSeq platform confirmed that 7 genes showed either promoter hyper-methylation (SMAD6, IFITM1, LRRC4, CHST4, and TBX15) or hypo-methylation (CCL20 and NQO1) in HCC.

PLOS Biology asked eight leaders spanning a range of related areas to give us their predictions. Without exception, the predictions are for more data on a massive scale and of more diverse types. All are optimistic and predict enormous positive impact on scientific understanding, while a recurring theme is the benefit of such data for the transformation and personalization of medicine. Several also point out that the biggest changes will very likely be those that we don't foresee, even now.

MYP1 is a locus for X-linked syndromic and nonsyndromic high myopia. Recently, unique haplotypes in OPN1LW were found to be responsible for X-linked syndromic high myopia mapped to MYP1. The current study is to test if such variants in OPN1LW are also responsible for X-linked nonsyndromic high myopia mapped to MYP1. METHODS. The proband of the family previously mapped to MYP1 was initially analyzed using whole-exome sequencing and whole-genome sequencing. Additional probands with early-onset high myopia were analyzed using whole-exome sequencing. Variants in OPN1LW were selected and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Long-range and second PCR were used to determine the haplotype and the first gene of the red-green gene array. Candidate variants were further validated in family members and controls. RESULTS. The unique LVAVA haplotype in OPN1LW was detected in the family with X-linked nonsyndromic high myopia mapped to MYP1. In addition, this haplotype and a novel frameshift mutation (c.617_620dup, p.Phe208Argfs*51) in OPN1LW were detected in two other families with X-linked high myopia. The unique haplotype cosegregated with high myopia in the two families, with a maximum LOD score of 3.34 and 2.31 at theta = 0. OPN1LW with the variants in these families was the first gene in the red-green gene array and was not present in 247 male controls. Reevaluation of the clinical data in both families with the unique haplotype suggested nonsyndromic high myopia. CONCLUSIONS. Our study confirms the findings that unique variants in OPN1LW are responsible for both syndromic and nonsyndromic X-linked high myopia mapped to MYP1.

Distribution of pilus islands and alpha-like protein genes of group B Streptococcus colonized in pregnant women in Beijing, China	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY & INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article							MOLECULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY; SURFACE-PROTEINS; AGALACTIAE; SEROTYPES; VACCINE; INFECTIONS; DISEASE	Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is one of the major pathogens of severe newborn sepsis and meningitis. Understanding its regional molecular epidemiology is helpful for regulating efficient prevention practice. A total of 160 GBS strains were collected from colonized pregnant women in six hospital settings in Beijing, China. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were used to identify the pilus island (PI), alp genes profiling of the alpha-like protein family, and capsular polysaccharide (cps) serotyping. The clonal relationships between strains were investigated using multilocus sequence typing (MLST). All isolates carried at least one pilus island. The most frequently detected pilus island was PI-2a alone (70 isolates, 43.8 %). The most prevalent alp gene was rib (60 isolates, 37.5 %). Moreover, a strong association was noted between alp genes, serotyping, and pilus island profiles. The GBS isolates under study hinted similar molecular epidemical characteristics in Beijing to those reported worldwide, but having their regional distributional features.

This study analyzed variants in 129 genes associated with other forms of hereditary retinal dystrophy in the same cohort. Methods: Apart from the 73 genes previously analyzed, a further 129 genes responsible for other forms of hereditary retinal dystrophy were selected based on RetNet. Variants in the 129 genes determined by whole exome sequencing were selected and filtered by bioinformatics analysis. Candidate variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing and validated by analysis of available family members and controls. Results: A total of 90 candidate variants were present in the 129 genes. Sanger sequencing confirmed 83 of the 90 variants. Analysis of family members and controls excluded 76 of these 83 variants. The remaining seven variants were considered to be potential pathogenic mutations; these were c.899A>G, c.1814C>G, and c.2107C>T in BBS2; c.1073C>T and c.1669C>T in INPP5E; and c.3582C>G and c.5704-5C>G in CACNA1F. Six of these seven mutations were novel. The mutations were detected in five unrelated patients without a family history, including three patients with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in BBS2 and INPP5E, and two patients with hemizygous mutations in CACNA1F. None of the patients had mutations in the genes associated with autosome dominant retinal dystrophy. Conclusions: Only a small portion of patients with RP, about 3% (5/157), had causative mutations in the 129 genes associated with other forms of hereditary retinal dystrophy.

The causative genes identified to date are KMT2D and KDMA6. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical manifestations and the spectrum of mutations of KMT2D. Methods: We retrospectively retrieved a series of eight patients from two hospitals in China and conducted Sanger sequencing for all of the patients and their parents if available. We also reviewed the literature and plotted the mutation spectrum of KMT2D. Results: The patients generally presented with typical clinical manifestations as previously reported in other countries. Uncommon symptoms included spinal bifida and Dandy-Walker malformation. With respect to the mutations, five mutations were found in five patients, including two frameshift indels, one nonsense mutation and two missense mutations. Conclusions: This is the first case series on Kabuki syndrome in Mainland China. Unusual symptoms, such as spinal bifida and Dandy-Walker syndrome, suggested that neurological developmental defects may accompany Kabuki syndrome. This case series helps broaden the mutation spectrum of Kabuki syndrome and adds information regarding the manifestations of Kabuki syndrome.

The increasing number of sequenced reptilian genomes is enabling a deeper understanding of vertebrate evolution, although the genetic basis of the loss of limbs in reptiles remains enigmatic. Here we report genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation for the Asian glass lizard Ophisaurus gracilis, a limbless lizard species with an elongated snake-like body form. Addition of this species to the genome repository will provide an excellent resource for studying the genetic basis of limb loss and trunk elongation. Findings: O. gracilis genome sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform resulted in 274.20 Gbp of raw data that was filtered and assembled to a final size of 1.78 Gbp, comprising 6,717 scaffolds with N50 = 1.27 Mbp. Based on the k-mer estimated genome size of 1.71 Gbp, the assembly appears to be nearly 100% complete. A total of 19,513 protein-coding genes were predicted, and 884.06 Mbp of repeat sequences (approximately half of the genome) were annotated. The draft genome of O. gracilis has similar characteristics to both lizard and snake genomes. Conclusions: We report the first genome of a lizard from the family Anguidae, O. gracilis. This supplements currently available genetic and genomic resources for amniote vertebrates, representing a major increase in comparative genome data available for squamate reptiles in particular.

A novel single nucleotide splice site mutation in FHL1 confirms an Emery-Dreifuss plus phenotype with pulmonary artery hypoplasia and facial dysmorphology	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS			English	Article						X-linked; Muscular dystrophy; Splice site mutation; Linkage analysis; Exome sequencing	MUSCULAR-DYSTROPHY; GENE; MYOPATHY; PCR	We describe a Danish family with an, until recently, unknown X-linked disease with muscular dystrophy (MD), facial dysmorphology and pulmonary artery hypoplasia. One patient died suddenly before age 20 and another was resuscitated from cardiac arrest at the age of 28. Linkage analysis pointed to a region of 25 Mb from 123.6 Mb to 148.4 Mb on chromosome X containing over 100 genes. Exome sequencing identified a single nucleotide splice site mutation c. 502-2A > T, which is located 5 ' to exon 6 in the gene encoding four and a half LIM domain 1 (FHL1) protein. FHL1 expresses three main splice variants, known as FHL1A, FHL1B and FHL1C. In healthy individuals, FHL1A is the predominant splice variant and is mainly found in skeletal and cardiac muscle. The FHL1 transcript profiles from two affected individuals were investigated in skin fibroblasts with quantitative real-time PCR. This demonstrated loss of isoform A and B, and an almost 200-fold overexpression of isoform C confirming that lack of FHL1A and overexpression of FHL1C results in an extended phenotype of EDMD as recently shown by Tiffin et al.

Comparative proteomic analysis of hyphae and germinating cysts of Phytophthora pisi and Phytophthora sojae	JOURNAL OF PROTEOMICS			English	Article						Effector; Germinated cyst; Lipid catabolism; Pathogenicity factors; Proteome; Vegetative growth	FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; COPROPORPHYRINOGEN OXIDASE; METABOLIC PATHWAY; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; PLANT-PATHOGENS; PHOSPHOLIPASE-D; RXLR EFFECTORS; LC-MS; GENE; INFESTANS	The recently described oomycete pathogen Phytophthora pisi causes root rot on pea and faba bean, while the closely related Phytophthora sojae is the causal agent of soybean root and stem rot. Differences in the pathogenicity factor repertoires that enable the two species to have distinct host specificity towards pea and soybean, were studied using tandem mass spectromeisy in a global proteome study of hyphae and germinating cysts in P. pisi and P. sojae. In total 2775 proteins from P. pisi and 2891 proteins from P. sojae were identified. Fifty-eight orthologous proteins were more abundant in germinated cysts of both pathogens and thus identified as candidate proteins for the infective stage. Several of these proteins were associated with lipid transport and metabolism, and energy production. Twenty-three orthologous proteins were more abundant in hyphae of both pathogens and thus identified as candidate proteins for vegetative growth. Proteins uniquely present in germinating cysts of either P. pisi or P. sojae were considered as candidates for species-specific pathogenicity factors that may be involved in host specificity. Among these proteins were serine proteases, membrane transporters and a berberine-like protein. These results significantly expand the knowledge of the expressed proteome in P. phi and P. sojae. Biological significance P. sojae and P. pisi are closely related species that specifically cause root rot on soybean and pea, respectively. The pathogenicity factors contributing to their host specificity remained unknown. We carried out a comparative large-scale proteome analysis of vegetative (hyphae) and infective (germinating cysts) life stages in P. pisi and P. sojae. This study provides knowledge of the common factors and mechanism involved in initiation of infection and species-specific proteins that may contribute to the host specificity of these pathogens. This knowledge will lead to a better understanding of the infection biology of these pathogens, allowing new possibilities towards developing alternative and effective plant protection measures.

Here we show that loss-of-function mutations in calpastatin (CAST) are the genetic causes of an autosomal-recessive condition characterized by generalized peeling skin, leukonychia, acral punctate keratoses, cheilitis, and knuckle pads, which we propose to be given the acronym PLACK syndrome. In affected individuals with PLACK syndrome from three families of different ethnicities, we identified homozygous mutations (c.607dup, c.424A>T, and c.1750delG) in CAST, all of which were predicted to encode truncated proteins (p.Ile203Asnfs*8, p.Lys142*, and p.Val584Trpfs*37). Immunohistochemistry shows that staining of calpastatin is reduced in skin from affected individuals. Transmission electron microscopy revealed widening of intercellular spaces with chromatin condensation and margination in the upper stratum spinosum in lesional skin, suggesting impaired intercellular adhesion as well as keratinocyte apoptosis. A significant increase of apoptotic keratinocytes was also observed in TUNEL assays. In vitro studies utilizing siRNA-mediated CAST knockdown revealed a role for calpastatin in keratinocyte adhesion. In summary, we describe PLACK syndrome, as a clinical entity of defective epidermal adhesion, caused by loss-of-function mutations in CAST.

Whole-genome sequencing to understand the genetic architecture of common gene expression and biomarker phenotypes	HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS			English	Article							WIDE ASSOCIATION; GENOTYPE IMPUTATION; IDENTIFICATION; VARIANTS; DISEASE; LOCI; SCHIZOPHRENIA; POPULATION; DISCOVERY; DECLINE	study to test two primary hypotheses: (i) that sequencing would detect single low-frequency-large effect variants that explained similar amounts of phenotypic variance as single common variants, and (ii) that some common variant associations could be explained by low-frequency variants. We tested two sets of disease-related common phenotypes for which we had statistical power to detect large numbers of common variant-common phenotype associations-11 132 cis-gene expression traits in 450 individuals and 93 circulating biomarkers in all 680 individuals. From a total of 11 657 229 high-quality variants of which 6 129 221 and 5 528 008 were common and low frequency (<5%), respectively, low frequency-large effect associations comprised 7% of detectable cis-gene expression traits [89 of 1314 cis-eQTLs at P < 1 x 10(-06) (false discovery rate similar to 5%)] and one of eight biomarker associations at P < 8 x 10(-10). Very few (30 of 1232; 2%) common variant associations were fully explained by low-frequency variants. Our data show that whole-genome sequencing can identify low-frequency variants undetected by genotyping based approaches when sample sizes are sufficiently large to detect substantial numbers of common variant associations, and that common variant associations are rarely explained by single low-frequency variants of large effect.

However, similarities in the genetic architecture and molecular regulations underlying phenotypic variations in humans and swine have not been systematically assessed. Results: We systematically surveyed similar to 500 F2 pigs genetically and phenotypically. By comparing candidates for anemia traits identified in swine genome-wide SNP association and human genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we showed that both sets of candidates are related to the biological process "cellular lipid metabolism" in liver. Human height is a complex heritable trait; by integrating genome-wide SNP data and human adipose Bayesian causal network, which closely represents bone transcriptional regulations, we identified PLAG1 as a causal gene for limb bone length. This finding is consistent with GWAS findings for human height and supports the common genetic architecture between swine and humans. By leveraging a human protein- protein interaction network, we identified two putative candidate causal genes TGFB3 and DAB2IP and the known regulators MESP1 and MESP2 as responsible for the variation in rib number and identified the potential underlying molecular mechanisms. In mice, knockout of Tgfb3 and Tgfb2 together decreases rib number. Conclusion: Our findings show that integrative network analyses reveal causal regulators underlying the genetic association of complex traits in swine and that these causal regulators have similar effects in humans. Thus, swine are a potentially good animal model for studying some complex human traits that are not under intense selection.

Due to the limited understanding of the molecular mechanism of pre-eclampsia, the current study conducted bioinformatic analyses to screen key regulators involved in pre-eclampsia. The gene expression profiling dataset GSE44711 containing 8 early-onset pre-eclampsia placentas and 8 gestational-age-matched control placentas was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Diff erentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened by limma software package, which were then subjected to Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis on the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery website. Finally, protein-protein interaction network was constructed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes database. In total, 192 DEGs including 106 upregulated and 86 downregulated genes were obtained. Proteoglycan 2 and podoplanin were the most significantly up-and downregulated genes, respectively. In addition, three potential pathways and their related DEGs: spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase 1, amiloride-binding protein 1 and adenosylmethionine decarboxylase 1 were associated with arginine and proline metabolism. Vascular endothelial growth factor C; phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit beta; collagen, type I, alpha 1 (COL1A1); and fibronectin 1 (FN1) were associated with focal adhesion. COL6A1 as well as COL1A1 and FN1 were involved in extra-cellular matrix-receptor interaction. The current study identified several potential genes and three pathways which may be considered as candidate targets for diagnosis and therapy of pre-eclampsia.

Recent studies have revealed that a subset of lncRNAs can regulate major biological processes during development. Here, we sequenced four tissues, including brain, colon, liver and lung, using RNA-seq across three developmental stages (early, middle and late stage), and then constructed genome-wide expression profiles during macaque development. In each tissue, we identified developmental time-specific lncRNA and mRNA clusters that displayed diverse expression alteration patterns, including a gradual increase, a gradual decrease, or a reversal of expression. These lncRNAs showed more specific functional associations with their corresponding tissues relative to the developmental time-specific mRNAs. Furthermore, we identified 20 spatiotemporal-specific co-modules including 101 lncRNAs and 609 mRNAs distributed at different developmental stages in different tissues. Our findings suggested that lncRNAs could play critical roles in the development of macaques through close cooperation with mRNAs. Finally, we predicted the functions of the spatiotemporal-specific lncRNAs by their spatiotemporal cooperation with mRNAs and further validated our findings using gene knockdown data of mouse. Our study reveals the spatiotemporal characteristics of lncRNAs and provides a functional map of the spatiotemporal-specific lncRNAs during the development of macaques.

G. soli strain GSS01T is of interest due to its ability to reduce insoluble Fe(III) oxides with a wide range of electron donors. Here we describe some key features of this strain, together with the whole genome sequence and annotation. The genome of size 3,657,100 bp contains 3229 protein-coding and 54 RNA genes, including 2 16S rRNA genes. The genome of strain GSS01(T) contains 76 predicted cytochrome genes, 24 pilus assembly protein genes and several other genes, which were proposed to be related to the reduction of insoluble Fe(III) oxides. The genes associated with the electron donors and acceptors of strain GSS01T were predicted in the genome. Information gained from its sequence will be relevant to the future elucidation of extracellular electron transfer mechanism during the reduction of Fe(III) oxides.

METHODS: A total of 165 PKU patients from China who had undergone a 24-h loading test with BH4 administration were recruited. Genotyping was performed by the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technique. Using the predicted residual PAH activity, we analyzed the association between genotype and BH4-responsiveness. RESULTS: Among the 165 patients, 40 patients (24.24%) responded to BH4. A total of 74 distinct mutations were observed, including 13 novel mutations. The mutation p.R241C was most frequently associated with response. Two known mutations (p.A322T and p.Q419R) and two novel mutations (p.L98V and IVS3-2A>T) were first reported as responsive to BH4. Residual PAH activity of at least 12.5% was needed for responsive genotypes. CONCLUSION: Genotype-based predictions of BH4-responsiveness are only for selecting potential responders. Accordingly, it is necessary to test potential responders with a long-term BH4 challenge.

Here, we report mass results obtained with an established and consistent porcine SCNT system (handmade cloning [HMC]). During the experimental period, 228,230 reconstructed embryos and 82,969 blastocysts were produced. After being transferred into 656 recipients, 1070 piglets were obtained. First, the effects of different types of donor cells, including fetal fibroblasts (FFs), adult fibroblasts (AFs), adult preadipocytes (APs), and adult blood mesenchymal (BM) cells, were investigated on the further in vitro and in vivo development. Compared to adult donor cells (AFs, APs, BM cells, respectively), FF cells resulted in a lower blastocyst/reconstructed embryo rate (30.38% vs. 37.94%, 34.65%, and 34.87%, respectively), but a higher overall efficiency on the number of piglets born alive per total blastocysts transferred (1.50% vs. 0.86%, 1.03%, and 0.91%, respectively) and a lower rate of developmental abnormalities (10.87% vs. 56.57%, 24.39%, and 51.85%, respectively). Second, recloning was performed with cloned adult fibroblasts (CAFs) and cloned fetal fibroblasts (CFFs). When CAFs were used as the nuclear donor, fewer developmental abnormalities and higher overall efficiency were observed compared to AFs (56.57% vs. 28.13% and 0.86% vs. 1.59%, respectively). However, CFFs had an opposite effect on these parameters when compared with CAFs (94.12% vs. 10.87% and 0.31% vs. 1.50%, respectively). Third, effects of genetic modification on the efficiency of SCNT were investigated with transgenic fetal fibroblasts (TFFs) and gene knockout fetal fibroblasts (KOFFs). Genetic modification of FFs increased developmental abnormalities (38.96% and 25.24% vs. 10.87% for KOFFs, TFFs, and FFs, respectively). KOFFs resulted in lower overall efficiency compared to TFFs and FFs (0.68% vs. 1.62% and 1.50%, respectively). In conclusion, this is the first report of large-scale analysis of porcine cell nuclear transfer that provides important data for potential industrialization of HMC technology.

PACAP-related peptide/pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PRP-PACAP) is a paralog of GHRH. These genes all play key roles in development and growth patterns. To improve the quality of cultured fish strains, natural genetic variation must be examined and understood. A mixed linear model has been widely used in association mapping, taking the population structures and pairwise kinship patterns into consideration. In this study, a mass cross population of orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) was examined. These candidate genes were found to harbor low nucleotide diversity ((w) from 0.00154 to 0.00388) and linkage disequilibrium levels (delay of 50% within 2 kbp). Association mapping was employed, and two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (KR269823.1:g.475A>C and KR269823.1:g.2143T>C) were found to be associated with growth (false discovery rate Q < 0.05), explaining 9.0%-17.0% of the phenotypic variance. The association of KR269823.1:g.2143T>C was also found via haplotype-based association (p < 0.05). The identified associations offer new insights into gene functions, and the associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may be used for breeding purposes.

Int Genetics & Translational Res T	Design and Implementation of the International Genetics and Translational Research in Transplantation Network	TRANSPLANTATION			English	Article							GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; ELECTRONIC MEDICAL-RECORDS; KIDNEY ALLOGRAFT FUNCTION; PRIMARY GRAFT DYSFUNCTION; CARDIAC TRANSPLANTATION; DONOR; POLYMORPHISM; RECIPIENTS; VARIANTS; GENOTYPE	Background. Genetic association studies of transplantation outcomes have been hampered by small samples and highly complex multifactorial phenotypes, hindering investigations of the genetic architecture of a range of comorbidities which significantly impact graft and recipient life expectancy. We describe here the rationale and design of the International Genetics & Translational Research in Transplantation Network. The network comprises 22 studies to date, including 16 494 transplant recipients and 11 669 donors, of whom more than 5000 are of non-European ancestry, all of whom have existing genomewide genotype data sets. Methods. We describe the rich genetic and phenotypic information available in this consortium comprising heart, kidney, liver, and lung transplant cohorts. Results. We demonstrate significant power in International Genetics & Translational Research in Transplantation Network to detect main effect association signals across regions such as the MHC region as well as genomewide for transplant outcomes that span all solid organs, such as graft survival, acute rejection, new onset of diabetes after transplantation, and for delayed graft function in kidney only. Conclusions. This consortium is designed and statistically powered to deliver pioneering insights into the genetic architecture of transplant-related outcomes across a range of different solid-organ transplant studies. The study design allows a spectrum of analyses to be performed including recipient-only analyses, donor-recipient HLA mismatches with focus on loss-of-function variants and nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms.

Familial IgAN is enriched with genetic variations predisposing individuals to the disease. Whole exome sequencing is an effective way to explore disease-causing genes and gene variants. Methods: We performed exome sequencing on the probands from each of ten IgAN families, and on one of the unaffected member from 7 of the families. Sanger sequencing, bioinformatics and co-segregation analysis were performed for all available family members to detect deleterious genetic variation. The relatedness of the families was tested by haplotype analyses. Results: Six deleterious variants in 4 genes were observed to be associated with IgA nephropathy by co-segregating with the disease phenotypes in study families. MYCT1 p.Asp22Glufs*34 was associated with IgAN by co-segregating with its phenotypes in families 2, 7, and 9; DEFA4 p.Ala8Pro, p.Ala8Val, c.172 + 1G>T co-segregated in families 1, 2, and 3; ZNF543 p.Pro226Ala co-segregated in families 3, 5, and 6 and CARD8 p.Val98Lysfs*26 co-segregated in families 7 and 8. Among these genes, MYCT1, CARD8 and ZNF543 are novel. Our haplotype analyses showed that families in which the same variation(s) were co-segregating with IgAN were unrelated, except for DEFA4. Of the families carrying DEFA4, families 2 and 3 were possibly related, but not family 1, indicating that common genes/variations in these families were not due to the same founder. Inter-familial sharing of different co-segregating genes was also observed, demonstrating the polygenic nature of this disease. Conclusions: We discovered 6 deleterious variants in 4 genes associated with familial IgAN. These genes are good candidate genes that appear to be causally related to IgAN and warrant further study.

It is believed that, in addition to production techniques and grains, different micro-ingredient compositions yield variations in aromas and tastes. The bacterial communities of the three key phases from Moutai liquor production were profiled with the Illumina sequencing platform. A total of 54 bacterial families were detected and the microbial structure showed clear differences among samples. In the starter-making phase, Leuconostocaceae and Enterococcaceae dominated the shaping stage, and Bacillaceae dominated the mature starter and ripening stages. In the latter two phases, Bacillaceae and Lactobacillales dominated in the early stage of stack fermentation and the anaerobic stage of pit fermentation, respectively. Most of the important microbes (approximately 26 families) might have originated from the starter and greatly affected the bacterial structure of the samples during the early stages of stack fermentation. Production techniques and environmental factors, such as temperature and oxygen, also shaped the unique bacterial composition during different phases.

Conversion of Uric Acid into Ammonium in Oil-Degrading Marine Microbial Communities: a Possible Role of Halomonads	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Crude oil degradation; Bioremediation; Alcanivorax	BACTERIAL COMMUNITIES; BIOREMEDIATION; PETROLEUM; WATER; SEA; DNA; BIOAUGMENTATION; MICROORGANISMS; DEGRADATION; POPULATIONS	Uric acid is a promising hydrophobic nitrogen source for biostimulation of microbial activities in oil-impacted marine environments. This study investigated metabolic processes and microbial community changes in a series of microcosms using sediment from the Mediterranean and the Red Sea amended with ammonium and uric acid. Respiration, emulsification, ammonium and protein concentration measurements suggested a rapid production of ammonium from uric acid accompanied by the development of microbial communities containing hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria after 3 weeks of incubation. About 80 % of uric acid was converted to ammonium within the first few days of the experiment. Microbial population dynamics were investigated by Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis and Illumina sequencing as well as by culture-based techniques. Resulting data indicated that strains related to Halomonas spp. converted uric acid into ammonium, which stimulated growth of microbial consortia dominated by Alcanivorax spp. and Pseudomonas spp. Several strains of Halomonas spp. were isolated on uric acid as the sole carbon source showed location specificity. These results point towards a possible role of halomonads in the conversion of uric acid to ammonium utilized by hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria.

But almost all non-photosynthetic plants and algae still retain a colorless plastid and an associated genome, which performs fundamental processes apart from photosynthesis. Unfortunately, little is known about the forces leading to photosynthetic loss; this is largely because there is a lack of data from transitional species. Here, we compare the plastid genomes of two "transitional" green algae: the photosynthetic, mixotrophic Auxenochlorella protothecoides and the non-photosynthetic, obligate heterotroph Prototheca wickerhamii. Remarkably, the plastid genome of A. protothecoides is only slightly larger than that of P. wickerhamii, making it among the smallest plastid genomes yet observed from photosynthetic green algae. Even more surprising, both algae have almost identical plastid genomic architectures and gene compositions (with the exception of genes involved in photosynthesis), implying that they are closely related. This close relationship was further supported by phylogenetic and substitution rate analyses, which suggest that the lineages giving rise to A. protothecoides and P. wickerhamii diverged from one another around six million years ago.

Our study aimed to develop a customized preconception-to-neonate care trajectory to fulfill this clinical demand by integrating preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), and noninvasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) into the strategy. Auditory and genetic diagnosis of the proband child was carried out to identify the disease causative mutations. The couple then received in-vitro-fertilization treatment, and eight embryos were obtained for day 5 biopsy. PGD was performed by short-tandem-repeat linkage analysis and Sanger sequencing of GJB2 gene. Transfer of a GJB2c.235delC heterozygous embryo resulted in a singleton pregnancy. At the 13th week of gestation, genomic DNA (gDNA) from the trio family and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from maternal plasma were obtained for assessment of fetal chromosomal aneuploidy and GJB2 mutations. NIPT and NIPD showed the absence of chromosomal aneuploidy and GJB2-associated disease in the fetus, which was later confirmed by invasive procedures and postnatal genetic/auditory diagnosis. This strategy successfully prevented the transmission of hearing impairment in the newborn, thus providing a valuable experience in reproductive management of similar cases and potentially other monogenic disorders.

In this study, we optimized our liquid hybridization capture-based bisulfite sequencing (LHC-BS) approach on the gene promoter regions of 11 cell lines. Our results indicated that promoter methylomes could not only cluster cancer cell lines with respect to tissue origins but also differentiate cancer subtypes based on CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP). Promoter-targeted LHC-BS as means for comprehensive screening and classifying cancer cells with promoter methylomes provided a powerful strategy for further complex clinical studies.

To discover the genetic risk factors and evaluate the performance of risk prediction model for the disease, we conducted genomewide association study and replication study with total of 174 cases and 1761 trichloroethylene-tolerant controls. Fifty seven SNPs that exceeded the threshold for genome-wide significance (P < 5 x 10(-8)) were screened to relate with the disease, among which two independent SNPs were identified, that is rs2857281 at MICA (odds ratio, 11.92; P-meta = 1.33 x 10(-37)) and rs2523557 between HLA-B and MICA (odds ratio, 7.33; P-meta = 8.79 x 10(-35)). The genetic risk score with these two SNPs explains at least 20.9% of the disease variance and up to 32.5-fold variation in inter-individual risk. Combining of two SNPs as predictors for the disease would have accuracy of 80.73%, the area under receiver operator characteristic curves (AUC) scores was 0.82 with sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 85%, which was considered to have excellent discrimination for the disease, and could be considered for translational application for screening employees before exposure.

No pathogenic mutations in GJB2, GJB3 and GJB6 genes were found in the siblings. By analysis of exome of the proband, we identified a novel missense (p.R306C) mutation and a nonsense (p.R186*) mutation in the BCS1L gene. Mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The siblings were compound heterozygotes, and the inheritance mode of autosomal recessive was postulated. BCS1L is the causative gene of Bjornstad syndrome, which is characterized by sensorineural hearing loss and pill torti. The longitudinal gutters along the hair shaft were found by scanning electron microscopy in our patient Therefore the diagnosis of Bjornstad syndrome was eventually made for the patients. Our study extends the phenotypic spectrum of Bjornstad syndrome and highlights the clinical applicability of exome sequencing as a diagnostic tool for atypical Mendelian disorders.

SMAP: a streamlined methylation analysis pipeline for bisulfite sequencing	GIGASCIENCE			English	Article						Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS); Differentially methylated region (DMR); Allele-specific DNA methylation (ASM)	DNA METHYLATION; READ ALIGNMENT; GENOME; CANCER; ACCURATE; PACKAGE; TOOL	Background: DNA methylation has important roles in the regulation of gene expression and cellular specification. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) has prevailed in methylation studies due to its cost-effectiveness and single-base resolution. The rapid accumulation of RRBS data demands well designed analytical tools. Findings: To streamline the data processing of DNA methylation from multiple RRBS samples, we present a flexible pipeline named SMAP, whose features include: (i) handling of single-and/or paired-end diverse bisulfite sequencing data with reduced false-positive rates in differentially methylated regions; (ii) detection of allele-specific methylation events with improved algorithms; (iii) a built-in pipeline for detection of novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); (iv) support of multiple user-defined restriction enzymes; (v) conduction of all methylation analyses in a single-step operation when well configured. Conclusions: Simulation and experimental data validated the high accuracy of SMAP for SNP detection and methylation identification. Most analyses required in methylation studies (such as estimation of methylation levels, differentially methylated cytosine groups, and allele-specific methylation regions) can be executed readily with SMAP. All raw data from diverse samples could be processed in parallel and 'packetized' streams. A simple user guide to the methylation applications is also provided.

Dysregulation of homeostasis can lead to inflammation of the colon (colitis), which can cause life-threatening enfeeblement or even cancer. Animal models are valuable surrogates in deciphering the pathology behind such human conditions and for screening of putative therapeutic targets or treatment paradigms. However, development of disease models can be time-consuming and technical demanding, which might hamper their application-value. In this study, we genetically disrupted the mouse Ace2 gene by direct injection of in vitro transcribed mRNA coding for transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) into the cytoplasm of outbred Kunming mouse zygotes. Consequently, somatic mutations were induced with an efficiency of 57 %, of which 39 % were frameshift mutations. Moreover, all modifications were stably transferred during germline transmission. In Ace2-knockout male mice (Ace2 (-/y) ), we observed severe chemical induced colitis, characterized by considerable weight loss, diarrhea and a shortened colon length. Histologically, Ace2 mutations resulted in the infiltration of leukocytes and the overt damage of the intestinal mucosal barrier. In addition, we detected an increased expression of inflammatory cytokines in the colon tissue of Ace2 (-/y) mice. Collectively, the data indicate that high targeting efficiency and heritability can be achieved in an outbred mouse model by zygote injection of TALEN mRNA. Furthermore, the generated Ace2 (-/y) mice display phenotypic traits reminiscent of colitis and we anticipate that such mice can be of value in studies of the intestinal microbiome or fecal transplantation.

In the current study, transgenic founder pigs, with controllable pig growth hormone (pGH) expression, were cloned via the handmade cloning method (HMC), and pGH expression levels were examined at the cellular and organismal levels. The serum pGH levels in 3 founder male pigs were found to be significantly higher after induction with intramuscular injection of doxycycline (DOX) compared to baseline. A daily dose of DOX was administered via feed to these animals for a period of 65 to 155 days. The growth rate, feed efficiency and pGH serum concentration increased in the DOX-induced transgenic group compared with the other groups. 8 numbers of animals were euthanized and the dressing percentage, loin muscle and lean meat percentage were significantly higher in the DOX-induced F1 transgenic group compared with the other groups. In this study a large population of transgenic pigs, with integrated controllable expression of a transgene, was obtained. The transgenic pigs were healthy and normal in terms of reproductive capability. At the same time, feed efficiency was improved, production processes were accelerated and meat yield was increased.

An integrated tool to identify these aberrations is essential in understanding diseases and in designing clinical interventions. Previous discovery methods based on whole-genome sequencing (WGS) require very high depth of coverage on the whole genome scale, and are cost-wise inefficient. Another approach, whole exome genome sequencing (WEGS), is limited to discovering variations within exons. Thus, we are lacking efficient methods to detect genomic aberrations on the whole genome scale using next-generation sequencing technology. Here we present a method to identify genome-wide CNV, LOH and UPD for the human genome via selectively sequencing a small portion of genome termed Selected Target Regions (SeTRs). In our experiments, the SeTRs are covered by 99.73%similar to 99.95% with sufficient depth. Our developed bioinformatics pipeline calls genome-wide CNVs with high confidence, revealing 8 credible events of LOH and 3 UPD events larger than 5M from 15 individual samples. We demonstrate that genome-wide CNV, LOH and UPD can be detected using a cost-effective SeTRs sequencing approach, and that LOH and UPD can be identified using just a sample grouping technique, without using a matched sample or familial information.

An uprising alterative to GPU is Intel MIC; supercomputers like Tianhe-2, currently top of TOP500, is built with 48,000 MIC boards to offer similar to 55 PFLOPS. The CPU-like architecture of MIC allows CPU-based software to be parallelized easily; however, the performance is often inferior to GPU counterparts as an MIC card contains only similar to 60 cores (while a GPU card typically has over a thousand cores). Results: To better utilize MIC-enabled computers for NGS data analysis, we developed a new short-read aligner MICA that is optimized in view of MIC's limitation and the extra parallelism inside each MIC core. By utilizing the 512-bit vector units in the MIC and implementing a new seeding strategy, experiments on aligning 150 bp paired-end reads show that MICA using one MIC card is 4.9 times faster than BWA-MEM (using 6 cores of a top-end CPU), and slightly faster than SOAP3-dp (using a GPU). Furthermore, MICA's simplicity allows very efficient scale-up when multiple MIC cards are used in a node (3 cards give a 14.1-fold speedup over BWA-MEM). Summary: MICA can be readily used by MIC-enabled supercomputers for production purpose. We have tested MICA on Tianhe-2 with 90 WGS samples (17.47 Tera-bases), which can be aligned in an hour using 400 nodes. MICA has impressive performance even though MIC is only in its initial stage of development.

Hitherto only about 30 ADNSHL-causing genes have been identified and many unknown genes remain to be discovered. In this research, genome-wide linkage analysis mapped the disease locus to a 4.3 Mb region on chromosome 19q13 in SY-026, a five-generation nonconsanguineous Chinese family affected by late-onset and progressive ADNSHL. This linkage region showed partial overlap with the previously reported DFNA4. Simultaneously, probands were analyzed using exome capture followed by next-generation sequencing. Encouragingly, a heterozygous missense mutation, c.505G>A (p.G169R) in exon 3 of the CEACAM16 gene (carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 16), was identified via this combined strategy. Sanger sequencing verified that the mutation co-segregated with hearing loss in the family and that it was not present in 200 unrelated control subjects with matched ancestry. This is the second report in the literature of a family with ADNSHL caused by CEACAM16 mutation. Immunofluorescence staining and western blots also prove CEACAM16 to be a secreted protein. Furthermore, our studies in transfected HEK293T cells show that the secretion efficacy of the mutant CEACAM16 is much lower than that of the wild type, suggesting a deleterious effect of the sequence variant.

To further understand the genetic spectrum of the disease, we analyzed a five-generation Chinese family with HME that have observable inheritance. Exome sequencing was performed on three HME individuals and three unaffected individuals from the family. A downstream study confirmed a new C deletion at codon 442 on exon 5 of the exostosin-1 (EXT1) gene as the only pathogenic site which generated a stop codon and caused the truncation of the protein. We rediscovered the deletion in other affected individuals but not in the unaffected individuals from the family. Upon immunohistochemistry assay, we found that the EXT1 protein level of the patients with the novel mutation in our study was less than the level in the patients without the EXT1 mutation from another unrelated family. For a deeper understanding, we analyzed the mutation spectrum of the EXT1 gene. The present study should facilitate a further understanding of HME.

These technologies have allowed for the rapid analysis, to date, of the genomes of more than 2,000 different species. In humans, NGS has arguably had the largest impact. Over 100,000 genomes of individual humans (based on various estimates) have been sequenced allowing for deep insights into what makes individuals and families unique and what causes disease in each of us. Despite all of this progress, the current state of the art in sequence technology is far from generating a "perfect genome" sequence and much remains to be understood in the biology of human and other organisms' genomes. In the article that follows, we outline why the "perfect genome" in humans is important, what is lacking from current human whole genome sequences, and a potential strategy for achieving the "perfect genome" in a cost effective manner.

Materials & methods: The tagmentation-based whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (T-WGBS) technology is modified, enabling stable library construction with complexity from minimally 0.5 ng of initial genomic DNA, which equals less than 100 mammalian cells. Results: We thoroughly assessed the performance of this T-WGBS method by sequencing the methylomes of a rice strain and pre-implantation embryos of rhesus monkey and compare to traditional WGBS approach, thereby demonstrating the efficacy of this new approach. Conclusion: This new approach is highly attractive for the complete methylome analysis of very few cells, for example, mammalian pre-implantation embryos, or tiny human biopsy specimens.

The difficulty is caused by the lack of knowledge about spermatogenesis molecular-controlling mechanisms. In vivo, PGCs differentiate into male germ cells in a very complicated environment through many middle steps. In this study, we use the pluripotent p19 cells to test their responses to different retinoic acid (RA) concentrations by evaluating markers for stem cells (bmp4, egr3), primordial germ cells (ddx4), spermatogonia (c-kit), premeiotic cells (stra8), and male germ cells (dazl and plzf). We have found that cyp26b1, which will catalyze RA, increases dramatically in p19 cells 1 d after RA treatment. Bmp3, egr3, and stra8 are stimulated after 1 d of RA treatment and then recover to normal after 3 d of RA treatment. C-kit keeps being expressed when treated with 10 nM-4 mu M RA. Dazl and plzf are gained after 3 d of stimulation. The morphology of RA (100 nM-4 mu M)-treated cells changes distinctively, and cell colonies are formed. Typical neural cell-like and germ cell-like morphologies appear in the 100 nM and 4 mu M RA groups, respectively. We conclude that 100-500 nM RA can cause responses in p19 cells, but a high concentration of RA (1-4 mu M) can drive these pluripotent cells' differentiation towards male germ cells. However, high concentrations of RA are also toxic. Some colonies that survived from 4 mu M RA begin to express ddx4 and c-kit. Selection of the c-kit (+) , dazl (+) , and ddx4 (+) cells after RA stimulation and creating a special culture medium for their propagation might benefit successful spermatogenesis induction in vitro.

In the DNA mixture simulation test, the PIRA-PCR assay was able to detect 3.0% target genomic DNA (gDNA) mixed in 97.0% wild-type gDNA isolated from whole blood. For plasma DNA testing, the results detected by PIRA-PCR assay achieved 100.0% consistency with those obtained from the amniocentesis analysis. This new method could potentially be used for NIPT of paternally inherited fetal mutants for beta-thal.

A.			A novel homozygous insertion and review of published mutations in the NNT gene causing familial glucocorticoid deficiency (FGD)	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS			English	Article						Exome sequencing; Familial; glucocorticoid deficiency; NNT; Mutation; Review	NICOTINAMIDE NUCLEOTIDE TRANSHYDROGENASE; ADRENAL FAILURE; READ ALIGNMENT; PATIENT; MITOCHONDRIA; DISORDER; PROTEIN	Familial glucocorticoid deficiency (FGD) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by low levels of cortisol despite high adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) levels, due to the reduced ability of the adrenal cortex to produce cortisol in response to stimulation by ACTH. FGD is a heterogeneous disorder for which causal mutations have been identified in MC2R, MRAP, MCM4 and TXNRD2. Also mutations in STAR and CYP11A1 can sometimes present with a phenotype resembling FGD. Recently, it has been indicated that FGD can also be caused by mutations in NNT (nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase). We identified a 6.67 Mb homozygous region harboring the NNT gene by SNP haplotyping in a 1-year old Dutch boy presenting with FGD, but without mutations in MC2R and MRAP. Exome-sequencing revealed a novel homozygous mutation (NM_012343.3: c.1259dupG) in NNT that was predicted to be disease-causing. The mutation is located in exon 9 and creates a frameshift leading to a premature stopcodon (p.His421Serfs*4) that is known to result in FGD. Both parents were shown to be heterozygous carriers. We reviewed the literature for all the reported NNT mutations and their clinical presentation. The median age of disease onset in 23 reported patients, including the present patient, was 12 months (range 3 dayse39 months). There was no difference in age of disease onset between truncating and nontruncating NNT mutations. Based on recent literature, we advise to monitor patients with FGD due to NNT mutations for possible combined mineralocorticoid insufficiency and extra-adrenal manifestations.

FUS and EWS are structurally and functionally related and participate in transcriptional regulation and RNA processing. FUS and EWS are identified in translocation generated cancer fusion proteins and involved in the human neurological diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and fronto-temporal lobar degeneration. Results: To determine the gene regulatory functions of FUS and EWS at the level of chromatin, we have performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next generation sequencing (ChIP-seq). Our results show that FUS and EWS bind to a subset of actively transcribed genes, that binding often is downstream the poly(A)-signal, and that binding overlaps with RNA polymerase II. Functional examinations of selected target genes identified that FUS and EWS can regulate gene expression at different levels. Gene Ontology analyses showed that FUS and EWS target genes preferentially encode proteins involved in regulatory processes at the RNA level. Conclusions: The presented results yield new insights into gene interactions of EWS and FUS and have identified a set of FUS and EWS target genes involved in pathways at the RNA regulatory level with potential to mediate normal and disease-associated functions of the FUS and EWS proteins.

Crowdsourced direct-to-consumer genomic analysis of a family quartet	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article						Crowdsourcing; Personal genomes; Participatory medicine; SNPs; Exome analysis; Microbiome; Family genomes; Direct-to-consumer; Genetic testing; Genomics	ALLELIC VARIANTS; INFORMATION; CONCORDANCE; CHALLENGES; MEDICINE; DISEASES; SYSTEMS; HEALTH; CANCER; GENES	Background: We describe the pioneering experience of a Spanish family pursuing the goal of understanding their own personal genetic data to the fullest possible extent using Direct to Consumer (DTC) tests. With full informed consent from the Corpas family, all genotype, exome and metagenome data from members of this family, are publicly available under a public domain Creative Commons 0 (CC0) license waiver. All scientists or companies analysing these data ("the Corpasome") were invited to return results to the family. Methods: We released 5 genotypes, 4 exomes, 1 metagenome from the Corpas family via a blog and figshare under a public domain license, inviting scientists to join the crowdsourcing efforts to analyse the genomes in return for coauthorship or acknowldgement in derived papers. Resulting analysis data were compiled via social media and direct email. Results: Here we present the results of our investigations, combining the crowdsourced contributions and our own efforts. Four companies offering annotations for genomic variants were applied to four family exomes: BIOBASE, Ingenuity, Diploid, and GeneTalk. Starting from a common VCF file and after selecting for significant results from company reports, we find no overlap among described annotations. We additionally report on a gut microbiome analysis of a member of the Corpas family. Conclusions: This study presents an analysis of a diverse set of tools and methods offered by four DTC companies. The striking discordance of the results mirrors previous findings with respect to DTC analysis of SNP chip data, and highlights the difficulties of using DTC data for preventive medical care. To our knowledge, the data and analysis results from our crowdsourced study represent the most comprehensive exome and analysis for a family quartet using solely DTC data generation to date.

Currently, glucocorticoid and splenectomy are the main therapies for ITP but with obvious side effects including tendency of relapse and risk of internal bleeding. In this study, we report the Mongolian medicine Qishunbaolier (QSBLE) can significantly and efficiently increase platelet count with a low recurrent rate and unnoticeable side effect. We profiled the microRNA (miRNA) expression in the blood sample of ITP patients and identified 44 miRNAs that are differentially expressed in ITP patients before and after QSBLE treatment. Out of these 44 miRNAs, 25 are expressed in control subjects and are downregulated in ITP patients, whereas the treatment with QSBLE restores their expressions to the level of control subjects. This result suggests that abnormal expression of these 25 miRNAs might be connected to the pathogenesis of ITP. Interestingly, 14 of those 44 miNRAs are predicted to target at least once on 31 known IPT associated genes, indicating the possible mechanism of QSBLE on ITP therapy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Mutations in 21 genes have been identified to be responsible for LCA. To detect the causative variants, we performed targeted next generation sequencing in two affected siblings of a consanguineous Chinese family with suspected LCA. A novel homozygous missense mutation (c.721C>T, p. Pro241Ser) of NMNAT1 has been identified. The mutation was inherited from their consanguineous parents who were heterozygous and was absent in 300 unrelated healthy individuals. NMNAT1, which encodes the nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 1, has been recently identified to be one of the LCA-causing genes. Our results expanded the spectrum of mutations in NMNAT1. In this study, targeted next generation sequencing provides an accurate and efficient method for identifying mutations in hereditary diseases with highly genetic and clinical heterogeneity.

Methods: Publications addressing the association between the VEGF +405G/C polymorphism and BC risk were selected from the PubMed, Embase and Google Scholar databases. Data were extracted from studies by three independent reviewers. The meta-analysis was performed by STATA 12.0 software, and odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Results: Finally, 10 case-control studies were retrieved with a total of 8,855 BC patients and 9,393 controls. No significant association was identified between VEGF +405G/C polymorphism and BC risk in overall populations under 5 models (C vs G: OR=1.001, 95% CI=0.896-1.119, p=0.987; CC vs GG: OR=1.006, 95% CI=0.853-1.186, p=0.997; CG vs GG: OR=0.985, 95% CI=0.823-1.178, p=0.779; CC vs CG/GG: OR=1.019, 95% CI=0.921-1.127, p=0. 722; CC/CG vs GG: OR=0.985, 95 % CI=0.835-1.162, p=0.862), and also in the subgroup analysis by ethnicity. Conclusion: Our study confirms that there is a lack of association between the VEGF +405 G/C polymorphism and BC risk.

Sham-transplant mice received their own stool. Stool samples were collected on day 0, day 13 (after ICR), and day 27 (after FMT) for whole metagenome shot-gun sequencing. Mucosal-associated bacteria were quantified with quantitative PCR and visualized by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Tissue cytokines were measured with multiplex arrays and mononuclear phagocyte populations by flow cytometry.Results:Surgery induced microbial functional and taxonomic shifts, decreased diversity, and depleted Bacteroidia and Clostridia. ICR mice had reduced colitis but worse ileitis with bacterial overgrowth, increased translocation, and reduction in tissue macrophages. FMT prevented ileitis but restored colitis and allowed for a bloom of -proteobacteria. In the colon, ICR and sham transplant were associated with recruitment of tolerogenic dendritic cells, whereas FMT shifted these immune cell subsets to control profiles along with increasing cytokine levels.Conclusions:This study suggests that surgical-induced immune dysfunction and microbial dysbiosis with impaired clearance may be the underlying cause of the early ulcerations found in the ileum of patients with Crohn's disease after ICR. FMT has an immunostimulatory effect on the postoperative intestine, which was beneficial in preventing ileitis, but detrimental in restoring colonic injury after surgery.

In this study, we constructed the first complete and deeply annotated genome of the genus Pontibacter (Pontibacter korlensis X14-1(T) = CCTCC AB 206081(T), X14-1). Reconstruction of the sugar metabolism process indicated that strain X14-1 can utilize diverse sugars, including cellulose, starch and sucrose; this result is consistent with previous experiments. Strain X14-1 is also able to resist desiccation and radiation in the desert through well-armed systems related to DNA repair, radical oxygen species (ROS) detoxification and the OstAB and TreYZ pathways for trehalose synthesis. A comparative transcriptomic analysis under gamma radiation revealed that strain X14-1 presents high-efficacy operating responses to radiation, including the robust expression of catalase and the manganese transport protein. Evaluation of 73 novel genes that are differentially expressed showed that some of these genes may contribute to the strain's adaptation to radiation and desiccation through ferric transport and preservation.

However, many of these genes are likely rare and not associated with susceptibility in Chinese CD patients. We found 294 shared identical variants in the CD patients of which 26 were validated by Sanger sequencing. Two heterozygous IFN variants (IFNA10 c.60 T > A; IFNA4 c.60 A > T) were identified as significantly associated with CD susceptibility. The single-nucleotide changes alter a cysteine situated before the signal peptide cleavage site to a stop code (TGA) in IFNA10 result in the serum levels of IFNA10 were significantly decreased in the CD patients compared to the controls. Furthermore, the IFNA10 and IFNA4 mutants resulted in an impairment of the suppression of HCV RNA replication in HuH7 cells, and the administration of the recombinant IFN subtypes restored DSS-induced colonic inflammation through the upregulation of CD4(+) Treg cells. We identified heterozygous IFNA10 and IFNA4 variants as a cause of impaired function and CD susceptibility genes in Chinese patients from multiple center based study. These findings might provide clues in the understanding of the genetic heterogeneity of CD and lead to better screening and improved treatment.

Methods: We describe an Italian family in which three sisters were affected by ataxia with postural/intentional myoclonus and involuntary movements at onset, which persisted during the disease. Oculomotor apraxia was absent. Clinical and genetic data did not allow us to exclude autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance and suggest a disease gene. Results: Exome sequencing identified a homozygous c.6292C > T (p.Arg2098*) mutation in SETX and a heterozygous c.346G > A (p.Gly116Arg) mutation in AFG3L2 shared by all three affected individuals. A fourth sister (11.7) had subclinical myoclonic jerks at proximal upper limbs and perioral district, confirmed by electrophysiology, and carried the p.Gly116Arg change. Three siblings were healthy. Pathogenicity prediction and a yeast-functional assay suggested p.Gly116Arg impaired m-AAA (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) complex function. Conclusions: Exome sequencing is a powerful tool in identifying disease genes. We identified an atypical form of Ataxia with Oculoapraxia type 2 (AOA2) with myoclonus at onset associated with the c.6292C > T (p.Arg2098*) homozygous mutation. Because the same genotype was described in six cases from a Tunisian family with a typical AOA2 without myoclonus, we speculate this latter feature is associated with a second mutated gene, namely AFG3L2 (p.Gly116Arg variant). We suggest that variant phenotypes may be due to the combined effect of different mutated genes associated to ataxia or related disorders, that will become more apparent as the costs of exome sequencing progressively will reduce, amplifying its diagnostics use, and meanwhile proposing significant challenges in the interpretation of the data.

Next generation sequencing is transforming molecular diagnosis of inherited neuromuscular disorders by identifying novel disease genes and by identifying previously known genes in undiagnosed patients. This is evident in two patients who were initially suspected to have a mitochondrial myopathy, but in whom a clear diagnosis of congenital myasthenic syndromes was made through whole exome sequencing. In patient 1, whole exome sequencing revealed compound heterozygous mutations c.1228C > T (p.Arg410Trp) and c.679C > T (p.Arg227*) in collagen-like tail subunit (single strand of homotrimer) of asymmetric acetylcholinesterase (COLQ). In patient 2, in whom a deletion of exon 52 in Dystrophin gene was previously detected by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, Sanger sequencing revealed an additional homozygous mutation c.1511_1513delCTT (p.Pro504Argfs*183) in docking protein7 (DOK7). These case reports highlight the need for careful diagnosis of clinically heterogeneous syndromes like congenital myasthenic syndromes, which are treatable, and for which delayed diagnosis is likely to have implications for patient health. The report also demonstrates that whole exome sequencing is an effective diagnostic tool in providing molecular diagnosis in patients with complex phenotypes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, 21 GRAS genes were identified from tobacco, and were classified into eight subgroups according to the classification of Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we provide a preliminary overview of this gene family in tobacco, describing the gene structure, gene expression, protein motif organization, phylogenetic analysis, and comparative analysis in tobacco, Arabidopsis, and rice. Using the sequences of 21 GRAS genes in Arabidopsis to search against the American tobacco genome database, 21 homologous GRAS genes in tobacco were identified. Sequence analysis indicates that these GRAS proteins have five conserved domains, which is consistent with their counterparts in other plants. Phylogenetic analyses divided the GRAS gene family into eight subgroups, each of which has distinct conserved domains and biological functions. Furthermore, the expression pattern of these 21 GRAS genes reveals that most arc expressed in all six tissues studied; however, some have tissue specificity. Taken together, this comprehensive analysis will provide a rich resource to assist in the study of GRAS protein functions in tobacco.	[Chen, Y. Q.; Wang, D. W.; Ding, A. M.; Sun, T. T.; Wang, W.

Advantage of Whole Exome Sequencing over Allele-Specific and Targeted Segment Sequencing in Detection of Novel TULP1 Mutation in Leber Congenital Amaurosis	OPHTHALMIC GENETICS			English	Article						Leber congenital amaurosis; retinitis pigmentosa; TULP1; whole exome sequencing	TUBBY-LIKE PROTEIN-1; ONSET RETINITIS-PIGMENTOSA; RETINAL DEGENERATION; READ ALIGNMENT; GENE-THERAPY; GENOME; MICE; DYSTROPHIES; FAMILY	Background: Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is a severe form of retinal dystrophy with marked underlying genetic heterogeneity. Until recently, allele-specific assays and Sanger sequencing of targeted segments were the only available approaches for attempted genetic diagnosis in this condition. A broader next-generation sequencing (NGS) strategy, such as whole exome sequencing, provides an improved molecular genetic diagnostic capacity for patients with these conditions. Materials and Methods: In a child with LCA, an allele-specific assay analyzing 135 known LCA-causing variations, followed by targeted segment sequencing of 61 regions in 14 causative genes was performed. Subsequently, exome sequencing was undertaken in the proband, unaffected consanguineous parents and two unaffected siblings. Bioinformatic analysis used two independent pipelines, BWA-GATK and SOAP, followed by Annovar and SnpEff to annotate the variants. Results: No disease-causing variants were found using the allele-specific or targeted segment Sanger sequencing assays. Analysis of variants in the exome sequence data revealed a novel homozygous nonsense mutation (c.1081C4T, p.Arg361*) in TULP1, a gene with roles in photoreceptor function where mutations were previously shown to cause LCA and retinitis pigmentosa. The identified homozygous variant was the top candidate using both bioinformatic pipelines. Conclusions: This study highlights the value of the broad sequencing strategy of exome sequencing for disease gene identification in LCA, over other existing methods. NGS is particularly beneficial in LCA where there are a large number of causative disease genes, few distinguishing clinical features for precise candidate disease gene selection, and few mutation hotspots in any of the known disease genes.

Replication of GWAS Coding SNPs Implicates MMEL1 as a Potential Susceptibility Locus among Saudi Arabian Celiac Disease Patients	DISEASE MARKERS			English	Article							GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; MULTIPLE COMMON; RISK VARIANTS; POPULATION; EXPRESSION	Celiac disease (CD), a gluten intolerance disorder, was implicated to have 57 genetic susceptibility loci for Europeans but not for culturally and geographically distinct ethnic populations like Saudi Arabian CD patients. Therefore, we genotyped Saudi CD patients and healthy controls for three polymorphisms, that is, Phe196Ser in IRAK1, Trp262Arg in SH2B3, and Met518Thr in MMEL1 genes. Single locus analysis identified that carriers of the 518 Thr/Thr (MMEL1) genotype conferred a 1.6-fold increased disease risk compared to the noncarriers (OR = 2.6; 95% CI: 1.22-5.54; P < 0.01). This significance persisted even under allelic (OR = 1.55; 95% CI: 1.05-2.28; P = 0.02) and additive (OR = 0.35; 95% CI: 0.17-0.71; P = 0.03) genetic models. However, frequencies for Trp262Arg (SH2B3) and Phe196Ser (IRAK1) polymorphisms were not significantly different between patients and controls. The overall best MDR model included Met518Thr and Trp262Arg polymorphisms, with a maximal testing accuracy of 64.1% and a maximal cross-validation consistency of 10 out of 10 (P = 0.0156). Allelic distribution of the 518 Thr/Thr polymorphism in MMEL1 primarily suggests its independent and synergistic contribution towards CD susceptibility among Saudi patients. Lack of significant association of IRAK and SH2B3 gene polymorphisms in Saudi patients but their association in European groups suggests the genetic heterogeneity of CD.

EDA mutation as a cause of hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia: a case report and review of the literature	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasias; Whole exome sequencing; EDA	FAMILY	Ectodermal dysplasia (ED) represents a collection of rare disorders that result from a failure of development of the tissues derived from the embryonic ectoderm. ED is often associated with hair, teeth, and skin abnormalities, which are serious conditions affecting the quality of life of the patient. To date, a large number of genes have been found to be associated with this syndrome. Here, we report a patient with hypohidrotic ED (HED) without family history. We identified that this patient's disorder arises from an X-linked HED with a mutation in the EDA gene (G299D) found by whole-exome sequencing. In addition, in this paper we summarize the disease-causing mutations based on current literature. Overall, recent clinical and genetic research involving patients with HED have uncovered a large number of pathogenic mutations in EDA, which might contribute to a full understanding of the function of EDA and the underlying mechanisms of HED caused by EDA mutations.

The International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) launched in 2007 is devoted to coordinate large-scale cancer genome studies in tumors from 50 different cancer types and/or subtypes and systematic studies of more than 25,000 cancer genomes. Several participant groups have summarized and published their data for various cancers. As the active members of ICGC, Chinese cancer genome investigators have contributed research for 13 tumor types and released some research articles about esophageal, liver, bladder, and kidney cancers. As genetic alterations in thousands of tumors have now been catalogued, the pancancer analysis has become the most significant role of ICGC at present. The ICGC research network will reveal the repertoire of oncogenic mutations, uncover traces of the mutagenic influences, define molecular subtypes for clinical implication, and enable the development of individual therapeutics for human cancers.

METHODS: A southern Chinese adCORD pedigree including 9 affected individuals was studied. Whole exome sequencing (WES), coupling the Agilent whole-exome capture system to the Illumina HiSeq 2000 DNA sequencing platform was used to search the specific gene mutation in 3 affected family members and 1 unaffected member. After a suggested variant was found through the data analysis, the putative mutation was validated by Sanger DNA sequencing of samples from all available family members. RESULTS: The results of both WES and Sanger sequencing revealed a novel nonsense mutation c.C766T (p.Q256X) within exon 5 of CRX gene which was pathogenic for adCORD in this family. The mutation could affect photoreceptor-specific gene expression with a dominant -negative effect and resulted in loss of the OTX tail, thus the mutant protein occupies the CRX 1112 binding site in target promoters without establishing an interaction and, consequently, may block transactivation. CONCLUSION: All modes of Mendelian inheritance in CORD have been observed, and genetic heterogeneity is a hallmark of CORD. Therefore, conventional genetic diagnosis of CORD would be time-consuming and labor-intensive. Our study indicated the robustness and cost-effectiveness of WES in the genetic diagnosis of CORD.

In the present study, we investigated the genotype and phenotype of a Chinese hypokalemic periodic paralysis family. We used whole-exome next-generation sequencing to identify a mutation in the calcium channel, voltage-dependent, L type, alpha subunit gene (CACNA1S), R900S, which is a rare mutation associated with hypokalemic periodic paralysis. We first present a clinical description of hypokalemic periodic paralysis patients harboring CACNA1SR900S mutations: they were non-responsive to acetazolamide, but combined treatment with triamterene and potassium supplements decreased the frequency of muscle weakness attacks. All male carriers of the R900S mutation experienced such attacks, but all three female carriers were asymptomatic. This study provides further evidence for the phenotypic variation and pharmacogenomics of hypokalemic periodic paralysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The phenomenon, which was also observed in more than 40 cell lines, led to an inquiry of causation of the different transcriptional statuses of the MPGs in the two chromosomes. We hypothesized that the special chromatin structure was a key element to regulate MPG transcription. Upon a systematical comparison of the effects of DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs), transcription factors (TEs), and histone modifications toward these genes or MPGs with/without mRNA evidence in chr11 and 19, we attributed the poor transcription of the MPGs to the weak capacity of these transcription regulatory elements, regardless of which chromosome the MPGs were located. We further analyzed the gene contents in chr11 and found a number of genes related to sensory functions in the presence of chr11. We postulate that a high number of sensory-related genes, which are located within special chromatin structure, could bring a low detection rate of MPGs in chill.

The aim of this study was to explore the effects of space flight on Klebsiella pneumoniae. Methods. A strain of K pneumoniae was sent to space for 398 h aboard the ShenZhou VIII spacecraft during November 1, 2011-November 17, 2011. At the same time, a ground simulation with similar temperature conditions during the space flight was performed as a control. After the space mission, the flight and control strains were analyzed using phenotypic, genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic techniques. Results. The flight strains LCT-KP289 exhibited a higher cotrimoxazole resistance level and changes in metabolism relative to the ground control strain LCT-KP214. After the space flight, 73 SNPs and a plasmid copy number variation were identified in the flight strain. Based on the transcriptomic analysis, there are 232 upregulated and 1879 down regulated genes, of which almost all were for metabolism. Proteomic analysis revealed that there were 57 upregulated and 125 downregulated proteins. These differentially expressed proteins had several functions that included energy production and conversion, carbohydrate transport and metabolism, translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis, posttranslational modification, protein turnover, and chaperone functions. At a systems biology level, the ytfG gene had a synonymous mutation that resulted in significantly downregulated expression at both transcriptomic and proteomic levels. Conclusions. The mutation of the ytfG gene may influence fructose and mannose metabolic processes of K pneumoniae during space flight, which may be beneficial to the field of space microbiology, providing potential therapeutic strategies to combat or prevent infection in astronauts.

METHODS: A 2.5 -year -old boy, who displayed nystagmus, photophobia, and hyperopia since early infancy, was clinically evaluated. To further confirm and localize the causative mutations in this family, targeted region capture and next -generation sequencing of candidate genes, such as CNGAS, CNOBS, aN,472, PDESC, and PDESH were performed using a custommade capture array. RESULTS: Slit-lamp examination showed no specific findings in the anterior segments. The optic discs and maculae were normal on fundoscopy. The unaffected family members reported no ocular complaints. Clinical signs and symptoms were consistent with a clinical impression of autosomal recessive achromatopsia. The results of sequence analysis revealed two novel missense mutations in CNGA. 7, c.6331->A (p.D211E) and c.1006G>T (p.V336F), with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. CONCLUSION: Genetic analysis of a Chinese family confirmed the clinical diagnosis of achromatopsia. Two novel mutations were identified in ONGA.?, which extended the mutation spectrum of this disorder.

Identification of Two Homozygous Sequence Variants in the COL7A1 Gene Underlying Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa by Whole-Exome Analysis in a Consanguineous Family	ANNALS OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article						Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa; exome sequencing; COL7A1; homozygous sequence variants; Saudi Arabia	GLYCINE SUBSTITUTION MUTATIONS; NEXT-GENERATION DIAGNOSTICS; VII COLLAGEN; CLASSIFICATION; DISORDERS; DOMINANT; DATABASE	Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) is an inherited skin disorder with variable severity and heterogeneous genetic involvement. Diagnostic approaches for this condition include clinical evaluations and electron microscopy of patients' skin biopsies, followed by Sanger sequencing (SS) of a large gene (118 exons) that encodes the alpha chain of type VII collagen (COL7A1) located on Chromosome 3p21.1. However, the use of SS may hinder diagnostic efficiency and lead to delays because it is costly and time-consuming. We evaluated a 5-generation consanguineous family with 3 affected individuals presenting the severe generalised DEB phenotype. Human whole-exome sequencing (WES) revealed 2 homozygous sequence variants: the previously reported variant p.Arg578* in exon 13 and a novel variant p.Arg2063Gln in exon 74 of the COL7A1 gene. Validation by SS, performed on all family members, confirmed the cosegregation of the 2 variants with the disease phenotype. To the best of our knowledge, 2 homozygous COL7A1 variants have never been simultaneously reported in DEB patients; however, the upstream protein truncation variant is more likely to be disease-causing than the novel missense variant. WES can be used as an efficient molecular diagnostic tool for evaluating autosomal recessive forms of DEB.	[Serafi, Rehab; Jelani, Musharraf; Almramhi, Mona M.; Mohamoud, Hussein S.

Correct annotation of the additional mutational complexity is, however, a prerequisite for establishing the mutational mechanism. We illustrate this point through the characterization of a novel approximate to 230 kb EXT1 duplication CNV causing autosomal dominant hereditary multiple osteochondromas. Whole-genome sequencing initially identified the CNV as having a 22-bp insertion at the breakpoint junction and, unprecedentedly, multiple breakpoint-flanking micromutations on both sides of the duplication. Further investigation revealed that this genomic rearrangement had a duplication-inverted triplication-duplication structure, the inverted triplication being a 41-bp sequence synthesized from a nearby template. This permitted the identification of the sequence determinants of both the initiation (an inverted Alu repeat) and termination (a triplex-forming sequence) of break-induced replication and suggested a possible model for the repair of replication-associated double-strand breaks.

As a widespread opportunistic pathogen, E. coli can survive not only by symbiosis with human, but also outside the host as well, which necessitates the evaluation of its response to the space environment. Therefore, to keep humans safe in space, it is necessary to understand how the bacteria respond to this environment. Despite extensive investigations for a few decades, the response of E. coli to the real space environment is still controversial. To better understand the mechanisms how E. coli overcomes harsh environments such as microgravity in space and to investigate whether these factors may induce pathogenic changes in E. coli that are potentially detrimental to astronauts, we conducted detailed genomics, transcriptomic and proteomic studies on E. coli that experienced 17 days of spaceflight. By comparing two flight strains LCT-EC52 and LCT-EC59 to a control strain LCT-EC106 that was cultured under the same temperature conditions on the ground, we identified metabolism changes, polymorphism changes, differentially expressed genes and proteins in the two flight strains. The flight strains differed from the control in the utilization of more than 30 carbon sources. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and one deletion were identified in the flight strains. The expression level of more than 1000 genes altered in flight strains. Genes involved in chemotaxis, lipid metabolism and cell motility express differently. Moreover, the two flight strains also differed extensively from each other in terms of metabolism, transcriptome and proteome, indicating the impact of space environment on individual cells is heterogeneous and probably genotype-dependent. This study presents the first systematic profile of E. coli genome, transcriptome and proteome after spaceflight, which helps to elucidate the mechanism that controls the adaptation of microbes to the space environment.

Molecular phylogenies have shown that these organisms represent the ancestral stock of flagellates from which all green plants (Viridiplantae) evolved. The molecular characterization of four different SAPs is presented. Three SAPs are type-2 membrane proteins with an arginine/alanine-rich short cytoplasmic tail and an extracellular domain that is most likely of bacterial origin. The fourth protein is a filamin-like protein. In addition, we report the presence of proteins similar to the integrin-associated proteins a-actinin (in transcriptomes of glaucophytes and some viridiplants), LIM-domain proteins, and integrin-associated kinase in transcriptomes of viridiplants, glaucophytes, and rhodophytes. Wepropose that themembrane proteins identified are the predicted linkers between scales and the cytoskeleton. These proteins are present in many green algae but are apparently absent from embryophytes. These proteins represent a new protein family we have termed gralins for green algal integrins. Gralins are absent from embryophytes. A model for the evolution of the cell surface proteins in Plantae is discussed.

The purpose of this study was to identify potential mutations in a Chinese patient with Joubert syndrome by targeted massively parallel sequencing. Taking advantage of high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies, 18 Joubert-causing genes of a Chinese patient with classic Joubert syndrome were sequenced at a time, and 2 novel variants in the CEP290 gene (c.7323_7327delAGAAG and c.6012-2A>G) were identified in this patient. Sanger validation showed that 2 variants were inherited from each parents, respectively. Both variants are located in the C-terminal region of the CEP290 protein and are predicted to be deleterious. The results support that the combination of targeted genes enrichment and next-generation sequencing is valuable molecular diagnostic tool and suitable for clinical application.

In this study, we describe a two-month-old boy who presented with hypertonia at first and developed to hypotonia progressively, which was in contrast to the manifestations reported previously. Bone tissue compromise was also observed as one of the unique symptoms. Muscle biopsy indicated mild myogenic changes. He was misdiagnosed until genetic screening to be confirmed as SMARD1. SMARD1 is a clinical heterogeneous disease and this case broadens our perception of its phenotypes. (C) 2014 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Using whole exome sequencing, we identified responsible gene of family 1572 with autosomal recessively non-syndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL). We also used DNA from 74 familial patients with ARNSHL and 656 ethnically matched control chromosomes to perform extended variant analysis. We identified two novel compound heterozygous missense mutations, c.3125 A>G p.D1042G (maternal allele) and c.5981 A>G p.E1994G (paternal allele), in the PTPRQ gene, as the cause of recessively inherited sensorineural hearing loss in family 1572. Both variants co-segregated with hearing loss phenotype in family 1572, but were absent in 74 familial patients. Heterozygosity for c.3125 A>G was identified in two samples from unaffected Chinese individuals (656 chromosomes). Therefore, the hearing loss in this family was caused by two novel compound heterozygous mutations in PTPRQ.

Methods: In this report, we have attempted to increase the awareness of unidentified pathogens by developing a method to investigate hitherto unidentified infectious pathogens based on unbiased high-throughput sequencing. Results: Our observations show that this method supplements current diagnostic technology that predominantly relies on information derived five cases from the intensive care unit. This methodological approach detects viruses and corrects the incidence of false positive detection rates of pathogens in a much shorter period. Through our method is followed by polymerase chain reaction validation, we could identify infection with Epstein-Barr virus, and in another case, we could identify infection with Streptococcus viridians based on the culture, which was false positive. Conclusions: This technology is a promising approach to revolutionize rapid diagnosis of infectious pathogens and to guide therapy that might result in the improvement of personalized medicine.

In this study, we developed a set of CSSL population consisting of 175 lines, which were derived between the recipient Guangluai 4' and the donor Nipponbare'. Based on 260 molecular markers, we firstly constructed a physical map of core 97 lines. Then, these 97 lines were further genotyped based on resequencing data, and a resequencing-based physical map was constructed. Compared with the molecular marker-based physical map, the resequencing-based physical map of 97 lines contained 367 substituted segments with 252 newly discovered segments. The total size of the 367 substituted segments was 1,074Mb, which was 2.81 times the size of rice genome. Using the 97 CSSLs as materials, we identified nine QTLs for heading date and three of them were firstly reported. All the QTLs had positive additive effects, ranging from 9.50 to 16.50 days. These CSSLs may greatly help forge a new resource for functional genomics studies and molecular breeding in rice.

Correcting positional correlations in Affymetrix (R) Genome Chips	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							GENE-EXPRESSION PATTERNS; SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; MICROARRAY DATA; REGULATORY NETWORKS; DNA MICROARRAYS; TECHNOLOGY; DATABASE; TOOL	We report and model a previously undescribed systematic error causing spurious excess correlations that depend on the distance between probes on Affymetrix (R) microarrays. The phenomenon affects pairs of features with large chip separations, up to over 100 probes apart. The effect may have a significant impact on analysis of correlations in large collections of expression data, where the systematic experimental errors are repeated in many data sets. Examples of such studies include analysis of functions and interactions in groups of genes, as well as global properties of genomes. We find that the average correlations between probes on Affymetrix microarrays are larger for smaller chip distances, which points out to a previously undescribed positional artifact. The magnitude of the artifact depends on the design of the chip, and we find it to be especially high for the yeast S98 microarray, where spurious excess correlations reach 0.1 at a distance of 50 probes. We have designed an algorithm to correct this bias and provide new data sets with the corrected expression values. This algorithm was successfully implemented to remove the positional artifact from the S98 chip data while preserving the integrity of the data.

The RNA extracted from blood, for example, represents the gene expression profiles of individuals or groups, and can be indicative of the pathological basis for human diseases. Meanwhile, the RNA quality may have severe impacts on the results of RNA studies. RNA is susceptible to many factors, such as the time of sample collection, transportation conditions, protectants, pretreatments, and extraction methods. In this study, six different pretreatment methods are evaluated for their effects on blood RNA extraction including the RNA yields and quality. Results show that most of these methods meet the basic requirements for RNA studies. While considering the simplicity of the procedure, the cost factor, and how to make full use of the samples, the proper method should be employed by researchers who have specific requirements for their research.

Almost all patients with PHHP have PHP Ib, a subtype of PHP that is usually caused by GNAS methylation defects, often in exon 1A. Some features of Albright hereditary osteodystrophy can occasionally be found in patients with PHHP, but these features are also common in Turner syndrome. The authors report on an extremely rare case of a patient with PHHP and Turner syndrome, a 47-year-old woman who sought medical attention for hypocalcemia and elevated parathyroid hormone. She had no family history of hypocalcemia and no STX16 gene deletions. She had a mosaic karyotype of 46, X, del(X)(p11.4)/45, XO. Pyrosequencing was performed to determine the GNAS exon 1A methylation. The degree of methylation found in exon 1A of the patient was lower than her unaffected relatives.

The RNC-mRNA data are reasoned to be useful for appraising the missing proteins. A set of the multiomics data including free-mRNAs, RNC-mRNAs, and proteomes was acquired from three liver cancer cell lines. On the basis of the missing proteins in neXtProt (release 2014-09-19), the bioinformatics analysis was carried out in three phases: (1) finding how many neXtProt missing proteins have or do not have RNA-seq and/or MS/MS evidence, (2) analyzing specific physicochemical and biological properties of the missing proteins that lack both RNA-seq and MS/MS evidence, and (3) analyzing the combined properties of these missing proteins. Total of 1501 missing proteins were found by neither RNC-mRNA nor MS/MS in the three liver cancer cell lines. For these missing proteins, some are expected higher hydrophobicity, unsuitable detection, or sensory functions as properties at the protein level, while some are predicted to have nonexpressing chromatin structures on the corresponding gene level. With further integrated analysis, we could attribute 93% of them (1391/1501) to these causal factors, which result in the expression products scarcely detected by RNA-seq or MS/MS.

We conducted a case-control study including 156 low-birth- weight infants as the case group and 100 normal-birth-weight infants as the control group. The rs900400 and rs9883204 variants were analyzed by gene sequencing in all the participants. Our results revealed a significant difference in the genotype distribution (chi(2) = 10.449, p = 0.005) and allele distribution (chi(2) = 9.277, p = 0.002) of rs900400 between the case group and the control group. The C allele of rs900400 was associated with lower birth weight (OR 1.771 [95 % CI 1.237-2.535]) in the Chinese population. However, the rs9883204 polymorphism was not informative in the Chinese population. Our study shows that the "birth weight-lowering" variant rs900400 located near LEKR1 and CCNL1, which is strongly associated with birth weight in European cohorts, appears to have a similar association in Chinese cohorts. However, the rs9883204 variant located in ADCY5 does not appear to be correlated with low birth weight in the same population. Moreover, we found that the variant rs900400 may also be associated with premature birth, thereby supporting the need for further research in this area.

GH binding to the growth hormone receptor (GHR) on hepatocytes prompts expression of insulin growth factor I (IGF-1) involved in nutritionally induced compensatory hyperplasia of pancreatic beta-cell islets and insulin release. A prolonged hyperactivity of the IGF-1/insulin axis in the face of insulinotropic nutrition, on the other hand, can lead to collapse of the pancreatic islets and glucose intolerance. Individuals with Laron syndrome carry mutations in the GHR gene resulting in severe congenital IGF-1 deficiency and elevated GH serum levels leading to short stature as well as perturbed lipid and glucose metabolism. However, these individuals enjoy a reduced prevalence of acne, cancer and possibly diabetes. Minipigs have become important biomedical models for human conditions due to similarities in organ anatomy, physiology, and metabolism relative to humans. The purpose of this study was to generate transgenic Wuzhishan minipigs by handmade cloning with impaired systemic GHR activity and assess their growth profile and glucose metabolism. Transgenic minipigs featuring overexpression of a dominant-negative porcine GHR (GHR(dm)) presented postnatal growth retardation and proportionate dwarfism. Molecular changes included elevated GH serum levels and mild hyperglycemia. We believe that this model may prove valuable in the study of GH functions in relation to cancer, diabetes and longevity.

However, some viruses, e.g. Turnip Yellow Mosaic Virus (TYMV, genus Tymovirus) have GC-rich genomes, raising the question as to whether or not DCL derived selection pressure affects these viruses. In this study we analyzed the virus-derived small interfering RNAs from TYMV-infected leaves of Brassica juncea showed that the TYMV population accumulated a mutational bias with AU replacing GC (GC-AU), demonstrating PTGS pressure. Interestingly, at the highly polymorphic sites the GC-AU bias was no longer observed. This suggests the presence of an unknown mechanism preventing mutational drift of the viral population and maintaining viral genome stability, despite the host PTGS pressure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, its performance is yet to match the massive amount of data to be processed. Experiments reveal that the main performance bottleneck of SOAPsnv software is the pileup algorithm. The original pileup algorithm's I/O process is time-consuming and inefficient to read input files. Moreover, the scalability of the pileup algorithm is also poor. Therefore, we designed a new algorithm, named BamPileup, aiming to improve the performance of sequential read, and the new pileup algorithm implemented a parallel read mode based on index. Using this method, each thread can directly read the data start from a specific position. The results of experiments on the Tianhe-2 supercomputer show that, when reading data in a multi-threaded parallel I/O way, the processing time of algorithm is reduced to 3.9 s and the application program can achieve a speedup up to 100x. Moreover, the scalability of the new algorithm is also satisfying.

Rs401681 polymorphism in TERT-CLPTM1L was of special interest for bladder cancer risk, whereas the results were inconclusive. Materials and Methods: Publications illustrating the association between rs401681 polymorphism and bladder cancer risk were collected from the Embase, PubMed and Google scholar. Three independent reviewers worked on the data extraction. The meta-analysis was performed by STATA 12.0. The odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for these data. Results: Six case-control studies were retrieved reporting a total of 9196 bladder cancer patients and 42570 controls. The strength of the relevance between rs401681 polymorphism and bladder cancer risk was evaluated by Stata 12.0 software. Rs401681[C] allele was identified marginally associated with increased bladder cancer risk, with per allele OR of 1.132 (95% CI=1.080-1.187, P-heterogeneity=0.701); in the stratified analysis by ethnicity, the increased cancer risk was revealed in Asian and Caucasian groups. Moreover, we also revealed that rs401681 polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer in Asian population with three publications under allele model (OR=3.722, 95% CI=1.311-10.568, P=0.014), whereas a decreased risk was identified in homozygote model (OR=0.692, 95 % CI=0.513-0.934, P=0.016) and recessive model (OR=0.728, 95% CI=0.541-0.980, P=0.036). Conclusion: In summary, our study provided evidence that rs401681 polymorphism is associated with the risk of bladder cancer.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the associations between selected single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and cerebral palsy among children. A case-control study was conducted, including 74 infants with cerebral palsy (case group) and 99 healthy infants (control group). The distributions of the allele and genotype frequencies were examined for the total cerebral palsy patient population in addition to subgroups divided according to gestational age (preterm versus full-term). The results showed that the rs1042714 variant in adrenergic receptor -2 (ADRB2) and heterozygosity for ADRB2 were associated with the cerebral palsy risk among the preterm infants. No significant differences in the allele or genotype frequencies were observed between the total cerebral palsy patient population and controls for the eight SNPs investigated.

In the present work, ripening characteristic of banana fruit after storage at 7 degrees C for 3 days or for 8 days, and expression levels of eight genes associated with ethylene biosynthetic and signaling, including MaACS1, MaACO1, MaERS1, MaERS3, and MaEIL1-4, were investigated. The results showed that banana fruit stored at 7 degrees C for 8 days exhibited more severe chilling symptoms than those at 7 degrees C for 3 days. Compared with banana fruit stored at 7 degrees C for 8 days, which showed abnormal ripening, more decrease in fruit firmness, while higher increase in ethylene production and hue angle were observed in banana fruit stored at 7 degrees C for 3 days, which could ripening normally. Moreover, gene expression profiles during ripening revealed that ethylene biosynthetic and signaling genes were differentially expressed in peel and pulp of banana fruit after storage at 7 degrees C for 3 days and 7 degrees C for 8 days. In the peel of fruit storage at 7 degrees C for 3 days, expression levels of MaACS1, MaACO1, MaEIL1, and MaEIL2 increased remarkably while MaERS3, MaEIL1, and MaEIL4 were enhanced in the fruit after storage at 7 degrees C for 8 days. In the pulp, with the exception of MaACO1 and MaERS3, expression levels of other genes did not exhibit a significant difference, between the banana fruit storage at 7 degrees C for 3 days and 7 degrees C for 8 days. Taken together, our results suggest that differential expression of ethylene biosynthetic and signaling genes such as MaERS3, MaACO1, and MaEIL2, may be related to ripening behavior of banana fruit with different degrees of CI after cold storage.

Beta-glucosidase is a common digestive enzyme that hydrolyzes cellulose in the diet to provide energy. In this study, the mRNA expression profiles of B. mori beta-glucosidase precursor (BmpreBG) were characterized by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The transcription level of BmpreBG varied in different tissues and developmental stages, except in the pupa and moth, which are the no-diet period. Remarkably, the mRNA expression level of BmpreBG was sharply reduced in l-4i but not in the wild type, which suggested that the digestive function of the mutant was severely damaged. This was consistent with the l-4i phenotypic traits of not eating mulberries, lack of energy, and ultimate death. 50-rapid amplification of cDNA ends showed, for the first time, that BmpreBG has a 160-bp 50-untranslated region. These findings suggested that B. mori beta-glucosidase precursor was involved in the death process of l-4i mutant larvae.

Three steps were followed to locate productive local groundwater aquifers prone to annual recharge in the Region of Petra, which covers an area of 800 km(2). In the first step, geological, structural and geomorphological knowledge was applied to determine the parts of the sedimentary basin having potentials of being local groundwater aquifers. Some locality of the selected area with suitable hydrological conditions for recharge was chosen for an optimization process using GIS. In the second step, the selected locality of the basin was given emphasize on its detailed geology and hydrology to choose suitable locality for applying gravity visualization. Evaluation of this data leads to step number three. Now at localities with promising conditions vertical electrical soundings was applied to enable the authors to determine productive and renewable groundwater aquifers. As it is known that geophysical methods are considered as expensive and time-consuming work, therefore, in this strategy of groundwater surveying a special attention is given to budgets of time, efforts and funds constraints.

Thus, fetching quickly high-resolution genotype is very important at present. However, current HLA DNA typing methods especially for HLA-DRB1 generally yielded ambiguous typing results because of high degree of heterozygosity on exome region and primer pairs design limitations, which generally amplified only exon2 of HLA-DRB1 and the position of its primer pairs is on exome region. To solve this problem, we developed a reliable, high-resolution and high-throughput (RHH) sequence based typing approach for HLA-DRB1 through massively parallel paired-end sequencing. Several primer pairs were designed to amplify three exon regions, which are part of exon1, the whole region of exon2 and exon3 of HLA-DRB1, to genotyping for HLA-DRB1 by synthesis. 94 samples were included to analyze and the highly successful genotyping ratio (98.94%) and no ambiguous genotyping result demonstrated the accurate performance of our method for HLA-DRB1 genotyping.

Antiproliferactive activity was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and TUNEL methods against human lung cancer cells (A549). Huang-lian regulated the Bcl-2 family protein-mediated mitochondrial pathway via p53 and was detected by western blot. It increased the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-3 cleavage increased as the time increased. These results suggested that Huang-lian regulated the Bcl-2 family protein-mediated mitochondrial via p53 pathway, suggesting that Huang-lian should be further investigation as a natural agent for treating and preventing cancer.

Laminin alpha-2 is widely expressed in the basement membrane of skeletal muscle, the myotendinous junctions and extra-synaptically at neuromuscular synapses. In the present study, target next-generation sequencing was used for mutation detection, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis and Sanger sequencing were used in the identification of small deletions. Subsequently, quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed to characterize the identified deletion encompassing exon five of the LAMA2 gene. Two causative mutations were identified using target region sequencing which provided the additional information required to facilitate clinical diagnosis. One heterozygous mutation (p. Lys682LysfsX22) was identified and confirmed by Sanger sequencing, and another heterozygous mutation (Exon5del) was found and validated by qPCR. Co-segregation analysis indicated that the Exon5del mutation originated from the proband's mother and the previously reported frame-shift mutation (p. Lys682LysfsX22) was inherited from the proband's father. To the best of our knowledge, the present study was the first to report an entire exon five deletion in the LAMA2 gene.

These peptides can either be synthesized chemically on solid supports or expressed biologically by concatenating multiple peptides together to a large protein. Neither method, however, has required versatility, convenience, and economy for making a large number of reference peptides. Here, we describe the biosynthesis of stable isotope-labeled peptides from a reconstituted Escherichia coli in vitro translation system. We provide a detailed protocol on how to express these peptides with high purity and how to determine their concentrations with easiness. Our strategy offers a general, fast, and scalable approach for the easy preparation of labeled reference peptides, which will have broad application in both basic research and translational medicine.

To determine the genetic cause of epileptic encephalopathy, we performed a multiomics study using mouse models of controls, anticonvulsant mice treated with five drugs and epileptic mice. Based on genome-wide profiling analysis, we discovered four genes in the epileptic mouse group with differentially-expressed mRNA. After isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) validation, only one gene, SNCA, remained, which was associated with apoptotic response of neuronal cells, and regulation of dopamine release and transport. We also identified three miRNAs targeting SNCA, out of which mmu-miR-21a-3p demonstrated a seven-fold change in expression between control and epileptic mice.

Identification of copy number variation in the gene for autosomal dominant optic atrophy, OPA1, in a Chinese pedigree	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Autosomal dominant optic atrophy; Mutation; Pedigree; Copy number variation; Optic atrophy protein 1	FRAMESHIFT MUTATION; DISEASE; FAMILY; POPULATION; PREVALENCE; NEUROPATHY; DYSTROPHY; FREQUENCY; VARIANTS; SPECTRUM	Autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA) is an optic neuropathy characterized by bilateral optic nerve pallor and decreased visual acuity. It has been reported to be associated with two genes, OPA1, OPA3, and the OPA4, OPA5, and OPA8 loci. However, mutations in OPA1 constitute the most prevalent cause of ADOA. The purpose of this study was to identify the underlying genetic defect in a Chinese pedigree with ADOA. DNA from six members of a Chinese pedigree was collected for testing genomic and copy number variation (CNV) by targeted region capture and next generation sequencing (targeted NGS). A new developmental CNV detection method was applied to analyze the sequence data. Further verification of CNV was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Three members of the pedigree with clinically diagnosed ADOA were screened for pathogenic genes related to ophthalmic genetic disease. No eligible pathogenic point mutations associated with ADOA disease-causing genes were found in pedigree members with ADOA. Upon further analysis for CNVs, we found a heterozygous deletion in exons 1-9 of OPA1, which was confirmed by real-time PCR. In this study we used a new developmental method to detect CNVs associated with ADOA in a Chinese pedigree. To our knowledge, this is the first case of ADOA caused by a CNV of the OPA1 gene in Chinese patients. The findings suggest that CNVs might be an important mutation type in Chinese patients with ADOA, and that CNV screening should be performed when point mutation screens are negative in these patients.

However, most of these loci have not been replicated in diverse populations and much genetic heterogeneity has been observed across ethnic groups. We tested 28 SNPs previously found to be associated with T2D by GWAS in a Mongolian sample of Northern China (497 diagnosed with T2D and 469 controls) for association with T2D and diabetes related quantitative traits. We replicated T2D association of 11 SNPs, namely, rs7578326 (IRS1), rs1531343 (HMGA2), rs8042680 (PRC1), rs7578597 (THADA), rs1333051 (CDKN2), rs6723108 (TMEM163), rs163182 and rs2237897 (KCNQ1), rs1387153 (MTNR1B), rs243021 (BCL11A), and rs10229583 (PAX4) in our sample. Further, we showed that risk allele of the strongest T2D associated SNP in our sample, rs757832 (IRS1), is associated with increased level of TG. We observed substantial difference of T2D risk allele frequency between the Mongolian sample and the 1000G Caucasian sample for a few SNPs, including rs6723108 (TMEM163) whose risk allele reaches near fixation in the Mongolian sample. Further study of genetic architecture of these variants in susceptibility of T2D is needed to understand the role of these variants in heterogeneous populations.

Traditional physiological measures, such as heart rate variation (HRV), blood pressure and electrodermal activity (EDA), are widely used but still have limitations in sensitivity, reliability and usability. In this study, we propose a novel photoplethysmogram-based stress induced vascular index (sVRI) to measure cognitive load and stress. We also provide the basic methodology and detailed algorithm framework. We employed a classic experiment with three levels of task difficulty and three stages of testing period to verify the new measure. Compared with the blood pressure, heart rate and HRV components recorded simultaneously, the sVRI reached the same level of significance on the effect of task difficulty/period as the most significant other measure. Our findings showed sVRI's potential as a sensitive, reliable and usable parameter.

Illumina's NGS instruments powerfully combine the flexibility of single reads with short-and long-insert paired-end reads, and enable a wide range of DNA sequencing applications. Here, we describe the paired-end library preparation with an average insert size of 470 bp, 2 kbp, and 6 kbp, together with the DNA cluster generation and sequencing procedure of E. coli O104:H4 genome on Illumina Hiseq 2000 platform.
